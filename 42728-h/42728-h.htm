<h1 title="">Forbidden Cargoes</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I
<br />A STRANGE MESSAGE</h2>
<p>In a plain board shack with a palm thatched
roof which had the Caribbean Sea at its front
and the Central American jungle at its back,
a slim, stooping sort of boy, with eyes that
gleamed out of the dark corners exactly like
a tiger&rsquo;s, paced back and forth the length of
a long, low room. His every motion suggested
a jaguar&rsquo;s stealth.</p>
<p>It was Panther Eye, a boy who was endowed
with a cat&rsquo;s ability to see in the dark,
and who spent much of his young life in India
and other tropical lands. He also found himself
quite at home in Central America. Nevertheless,
at this moment he was in deep trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>The palm thatched shack boasted but one
room. As the boy paced the mahogany floor
of this room he passed a desk of roughly hewn
rosewood. A small steel safe stood in one
corner, the door slightly ajar. Before it on
the floor lay a litter of papers, a few bundles
of letters and a sizeable roll of currency. The
boy paused to consider this litter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the map they wanted,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;Easy enough to see that. They didn&rsquo;t
even look at the money, nearly a thousand
dollars. The map! They knew we could do
nothing without the map. The dirty dogs!
If only Johnny Thompson were here!&rdquo; Again
he paced the floor.</p>
<p>What was to be done? His thoughts were
in a tangle. The thieves who had broken into
the safe were now well away in the jungle.
There was no time to be lost. He&rsquo;d catch
them, he was sure of that. A jaguar couldn&rsquo;t
escape him, much less a man. Yet the map
might be destroyed. Without it nothing could
be accomplished. Thousands were at stake,
the treasure of a lifetime. And some one
dearer to Pant than life itself was scheduled
to lose. All day in that stuffy office he
had waited for Johnny. Now evening was
near.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only Johnny would come!&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>Had he but known it, his good pal, Johnny
Thompson, was some three hundred miles
away. What was more, he was behind iron
bars in a stout stone jail. But this Pant could
not know, so he continued to pace the floor.</p>
<p>As the first long shadow of a palm darkened
the window he suddenly sprang into action.
Throwing up the lid of a rough chest, he
tossed out a miscellaneous assortment of articles,
some small oilcloth wrapped packages,
a black box, some fibre trays, a few articles of
clothing and a curious instrument of iron.
These he packed carefully in a kit bag, then
closed the chest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>Seating himself at the desk in the corner,
he began pecking at a small portable typewriter.
He destroyed four half written sheets
before he did one to suit him. The following
is what appeared on the one he at last weighted
down upon the desk:</p>
<pre>
  /9*::6
  5*3 ;@0 8$ -9:3 5*3 $0@:8@4%$
  *@'3 85 8 @; -98:- 8:59 5*3
  /7:-#3 @!534 85 8 28## -35 85
  :3'34 !3@4 #99= 975 !94 @ $0@:-
  8@4% :@;3% %8@( *3 8$ @
  %3'8# :3'34 547$5 :94 '3#83'3 *8;
  !94 @ ;9;3:5
            -99% #7?=
              0@:5
</pre>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he sighed as he turned from the
desk. &ldquo;If Johnny Thompson doesn&rsquo;t make
that out right away he won&rsquo;t be coming up
to my expectations. And if any of these
blacks and browns and whites that infest this
waterfront can read it, I take off my hat to
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning about, he slung the strap of his
kit bag across his shoulder and leaving the
cabin, disappeared into the gathering night
and the jungle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>Some hours later he might have been found
crouching close to the side of a bamboo hut
at the heart of the jungle.</p>
<p>His hands trembled as he unwrapped a
water-proof package. They trembled still
more as he poured a gray powder from the
package to a narrow V shaped piece of iron.
A little of the powder was spilled over the side
and, sinking into the deep bed of tropical
moss, was lost forever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; he told himself, stiffening his
shoulders. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get hold of myself.
If I don&rsquo;t keep cool I&rsquo;ll make a mess of it and
like as not get caught in the bargain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caught by those Spaniards in the heart
of the jungle!&rdquo; He shuddered at the thought.
&ldquo;Caught. And what then?&rdquo; He dared not
think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; His resolve was strong. &ldquo;They
shall not get me, and I shall succeed. I must!&rdquo;
His face grew tense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>At that he went ahead with his task. Having
spread the gray powder evenly along the
iron trough, he ran a small black fuse half
through it, then gave the fuse five turns about
it. When he had finished, the lower end of
the fuse hung some six inches below the
trough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he sighed.</p>
<p>A half hour later found him still crouching
at the back of that cabin. This shelter, for it
was little more, was of the sort common to
the Central American jungle. In its construction
not a board and not a single nail was used.
A number of cohune nut palms had been felled.
Their great fronds had been stripped. The
fibre stripped from the stems had been piled
in a heap, the stems themselves in another
heap. Crotched mahogany limbs were fastened
together with tie-tie vines. This made
a frame. Rafters were added. The bamboo
leaf fibre had been laid carefully in tiers over
the rafters. This made a perfect roof. After
that the ten foot stems of a great number of
leaves were fastened side by side in a perpendicular
position to form walls. When this
was completed the house was ready to be occupied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>The cracks between the upright bamboo
stems forming the walls were wide. A faint
light shone through these cracks, and through
them the boy could see all that went on within.
All this interested him, but he was filled
with a fever of impatience. He had come to
act, not to listen.</p>
<p>Two dark-faced Spaniards sat in the center
of the room. Two black bushmen lay
sprawled upon the dirt floor. Before them,
suspended upon a bamboo frame, was a map.
The map, some four feet across, showed certain
boundary lines, creeks and rivers. There
were spots that had been done in blue. Still
others were crisscrossed by pen lines, while
larger portions were left white. The figure
of one Spaniard hid part of the map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; The boy breathed an inaudible
sigh of relief as the man moved, allowing a
full view of the map. &ldquo;Now, if only I can
do it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>With the greatest care, he thrust the triangle
of steel upon which the powder rested
through a crack. Next he adjusted a small
black box before the crack, but lower down.
Then, with a hand that still trembled slightly
in spite of his efforts at self control, he drew
a sulphur match across a dry bit of wood.</p>
<p>The sulphur fumes rose and floated through
the cracks. At the same time there came the
faint sput-sput-sput of a burning fuse. One
of the Spaniards arose and sniffed the air. He
spoke a word to a companion. They turned
half about. And still the fuse burned.
Shorter and shorter it became, closer and
closer to the powder.</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s heart was in his throat. Was
the whole affair to be spoiled by a whiff of
sulphur or a fuse that burned too long?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they rise, if they block the view,&rdquo; he
thought, &ldquo;then all will be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>But no, they settled back. The whiff of
sulphur had passed. But what was this? A
black man jumped. Had the smell of burnt
powder reached him? Had the sput-sput of
the fuse reached his sensitive ear?</p>
<p>Whatever it was, it came too late. Of a
sudden there sounded out a loud boom, and
at once, for a fraction of a second, the whole
place, cabin, bamboo trees, and the surrounding
jungle was lighted as with a moment&rsquo;s return
of the sun. Then came sudden and
complete darkness.</p>
<p>Within was noise and confusion. A bushman
had overturned the candle. It had gone
out. In fright and rage at an unknown phenomenon,
an unseen enemy, the men fought
their way to the door, then out into the night.
Before this happened, however, the boy, hugging
his precious black box under his arm,
had lost himself in the jungle.</p>
<p>As we have said, this boy had lived much in
the tropics. The Central American jungle
was not new to him. Deep secrets of these
wilds had come to him by day and by night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>With the startled cries of Spaniards and
bushmen ringing in his ears, he made his way
swiftly, silently down a narrow deer path to
a spot where he had hidden his canvas bound
kit bag.</p>
<p>Thrusting his black box deep within the
bundle, still without a light, he made his way
swiftly forward until the shouts died away
in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only it is a success!&rdquo; he thought with
a sigh as he paused to adjust his pack.</p>
<p>Coming at last to a narrow stream he cast
a few darting glances about him. The jungle
here was new to him, yet the bubbling stream,
the moss on the tree trunks, the tossing leaves
far above him, told him all he needed to know.</p>
<p>Turning sharply to the right, he followed a
narrow trail up the winding bank of the
stream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>He had been traveling steadily up this
stream for more than three hours when he
came upon a place where the stream was a
roaring young cataract, tumbling down a
series of little falls. This was the thing he
had expected. He was sleepy. The night
was far spent. In his pack was a mosquito
bar canopy and a light, strong hammock,
woven from linen thread. With these he could
quickly build a safe wilderness home. In the
low swamp land, where malaria and mosquitoes
lurked, he did not dare to camp.</p>
<p>There were wild creatures in all this jungle;
crocodiles, droves of wild pigs, great boa constrictors
and golden coated jaguars. For this
boy all these held little terror. But the
swamps were not for him. The higher slopes
of the narrow peninsula offered fresher air,
and cooling breezes that lull one to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleep,&rdquo; he whispered to himself, &ldquo;and
after that a dark place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the moonlight, falling
through an open space among the trees and
spreading a yellow gleam upon the trail,
showed him that which brought him up short.
In a damp spot at the base of a rock were
footprints, the marks of a slim foot clad in
sandals, and stranger than this in so wild a
spot, the marks of a leather shoe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; He stood for a moment in perplexity.</p>
<p>One who knows the jungle is seldom surprised
at what he finds there. Pant was surprised.
This portion of the jungle was new to
him. &ldquo;Twenty miles from the coast,&rdquo; he
murmured. &ldquo;How strange!&rdquo;</p>
<p>More was to follow. He had not gone a
hundred yards farther before he came upon
a well-beaten road. A little beyond this spot,
in the midst of a broad clearing, half hidden
by stately royal palms, gleaming white in the
moonlight, was a long, low stone house which
in this land might almost pass for a mansion.</p>
<p>Pausing, he stood there in the moonlight,
staring and irresolute. It had all come to him
in a flash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last of the Dons,&rdquo; he said to himself.
Something akin to awe crept into his
tone. &ldquo;I had forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what now?&rdquo; he asked himself a moment
later. &ldquo;The jungle or this?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>In the end he chose the castle before him.
&ldquo;Might be a dark place up there somewhere,
an abandoned cellar perhaps,&rdquo; was his final
comment.</p>
<p>Having chosen a secluded spot at the side of
the trail where he might hang his hammock
and spread his canopy to sleep the rest of
the night through, he went quickly to rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard that they are friendly, and
honorable Spaniards. There are such, plenty
of them. I&rsquo;ll risk it. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that, with the breeze swaying his hammock,
he fell asleep.</p>
<p>The sun was sending its first yellow gleams
among the palms when he awoke. For a
time, with the damp sweet odor of morning
in his nostrils, he lay there thinking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>A strange mission had brought him into the
jungle. This strange boy had grown up with
little or no knowledge of blood relations. His
father and mother were but a dim, indistinct
memory. They had passed from his life; he
did not know exactly how. No cozy home
fireside had gleamed for him. He had gone
out into the world with an unanswered longing
for some one whom he might think of as
a kinsman. Bravely he had fought his way
through alone. When Johnny Thompson
came into his life and remained there to become
his inseparable pal, life had been more
joyous. Yet ever there remained a haunting
dream that somehow, somewhere in his wild
wanderings he would come upon one who
bore his name, who could give him the traditions
of a family and of a past.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, it had been at the edge
of the Central American jungle that he came
upon this person of his dreams. While walking
upon the coral beach he had met a stately,
white-haired old man who had the military
bearing of a colonel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>In this old man he had found a friend. Little
enough was left of the fortunes which from
time to time had come to the venerable southerner.
But such as he had he shared unsparingly
with the young stranger who had come
so recently from the land of his birth; for
Colonel Longstreet, as the patriarch styled
himself, though now for more than sixty years
a resident of Central America, had fought valiantly
for a lost cause when the Gray stood
embattled against the Blue in that long and
terrible struggle, the Civil War.</p>
<p>Broken hearted because of the outcome of
the war, he had left his native state of Virginia
and had come to Central America. His
life had been further embittered by the early
death of his wife. His only child, a boy of
ten, had been sent back to Virginia while he
struggled on, wresting a fortune from the
jungle.</p>
<p>Life in Central America is one gamble after
another. Longstreet had played in every
game. He had always won, in the end to lose
again. Fortunes in sugar, bananas and mahogany
had been his. Sudden drops in prices,
a revolution, the dread Panama disease, had
cost him all of these. Now he was playing
a last, lone card. Influential friends were endeavoring
to secure for him a concession for
gathering chicle on broad tracts of Government
land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>This was the state of affairs when Pant had
made his acquaintance. Hardly had their acquaintance
ripened into deep friendship when
they made the sudden and startling discovery
that Pant was the son of the boy who had
been sent back by Colonel Longstreet to Virginia,
that Colonel Longstreet was none other
than Pant&rsquo;s grandfather. From that time
forth the strange boy, who had longed for
so many lonely years for one of kin, became
the old man&rsquo;s devoted slave.</p>
<p>There was need enough at the present time
for such devotion.</p>
<p>Fortune had seemed to smile at last.
Through the influence of his friends, a concession
from the British Government for gathering
chicle had come from England to Colonel
Longstreet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Chicle, as you may know,&rdquo; the old man
had smiled, as he told Pant of it, &ldquo;is the basis
of all good chewing gum. Were it not for the
great American game of chewing it wouldn&rsquo;t
be worth a red cent. As it is, with one company
importing two million dollars worth a
year and other smaller companies competing
and yelling for more, there&rsquo;s a fortune in it.
There is a net profit of twenty-five cents a
pound on chicle. With proper working, our
tract should yield between twenty-five and
fifty thousand pounds a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the writings of agreement had come a
map showing the exact boundaries of the
Government tract they had leased. To the
right and above this tract was shown on the
map the holdings of a powerful American organization.
To the left were tracts leased by
an unprincipled Spaniard named Diaz.</p>
<p>Two days after news of the fortunate concession
had gone about the little city, Diaz
had appeared in the Colonel&rsquo;s small office. He
offered a ridiculously low price for the concession.
His offer was rejected. He was told
that the owner meant to work the concession.
He shrugged his shoulders and said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No get the men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man had straightened to his full
height as he informed the Spaniard that he
had men who could be depended upon to go
anywhere, to do anything. They had worked
with him and knew the honor that lay behind
the Longstreet name.</p>
<p>Diaz had begged, entreated, stormed, threatened,
then in a rage had left the office.</p>
<p>Two days had passed. On the third day
Pant had come to the office only to find the
safe looted, the map gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;We know
Diaz has it, but we can&rsquo;t prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot,&rdquo; the old Colonel had agreed.
&ldquo;Nor is there a chance of getting another before
it is too late. The bleeding season for
chicle begins with the first rainfall. To begin
without a map is to court disaster. With a big
and jealous American company on one side of
us and a crooked Spaniard on the other, we are
between the rocks and the tide. We are sure
to encroach upon one or the other. And if we
do, it will take all we have to fight their claims.
It looks like defeat.&rdquo; He had cupped his hands
and had stared gloomily at the sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; Pant had said. &ldquo;Johnny Thompson
will help us out. Give us a little time.
We&rsquo;ll find the map. Leave it to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny Thompson, as you already know,
could not help. He was not there. Two days
before he had gone up the Stann Creek Railway.
He had not returned. He was in jail.
Pant had been obliged to go it alone. &ldquo;And
now in this short time,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;I
have located the map here in the heart of the
jungle. No, I haven&rsquo;t got it. That couldn&rsquo;t
be done without bloodshed. But I have its
equivalent, I hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dark place!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I must
find a spot that is absolutely dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he sprang from his hammock he paused
to listen. Some one was singing. In a clear
girlish voice there came the words of a quaint
old Spanish song.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>As he parted the branches he saw a plump
Spanish girl, with a round face and sober
brown eyes, tripping barefoot down the path.
Balanced on her head was a large stone jar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going for the morning water,&rdquo; the boy told
himself. &ldquo;How like those old Bible pictures
it all is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later he found himself within
the white walls of that ancient and mysterious
castle, which had a few hours before
loomed so wonderfully out of the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II
<br />AN UNDERGROUND SEA</h2>
<p>Pant sat in a kitchen so broad and long that
it reminded him of a picture he had seen in an
illustrated copy of Ivanhoe. The table, on
which rested his steaming cup of home grown,
home roasted coffee, was a massive hand-hewn
affair. On the top, a single slab of mahogany
six feet wide and four inches thick, axe marks
were yet to be seen.</p>
<p>As his glance took in the room his heart
swelled with admiration. There was no stove.
A great fireplace was there in its stead. Pots
and pans of iron, and of copper and black tin,
hung from the rafters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like Longfellow&rsquo;s ancient home,&rdquo; he told
himself. &ldquo;Only this is to-day. The last of
the Dons!&rdquo; he repeated in a tone of reverence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>One thing puzzled him. Every article in the
room, save two, belonged to yesterday&mdash;a purple
coat hanging in a corner and a boy&rsquo;s cap
beside it&mdash;were distinctly of to-day and American
made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t belong to the young girl,&rdquo; he
told himself. &ldquo;Nor to her grandmother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bent and aged woman who must be the
young Spanish girl&rsquo;s grandmother was at that
moment offering him his second cup of coffee.</p>
<p>His thoughts were cut short by the answer
to his problem. A tall, fair-haired American
boy, apparently in his early teens, parted the
heavy homespun curtains at the back of the
room and started towards the table.</p>
<p>Seeing Pant, he halted in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said Pant, springing to his
feet. &ldquo;Perhaps I intrude. I had supposed
that this house belonged to these good Spanish
people. Apparently it is your home instead.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; The strange boy&rsquo;s smile was frank,
disarming. &ldquo;You were right the first time.
Like you, I am an intruder. But you are
from America,&rdquo; he added quickly. &ldquo;How
perfectly grand! Won&rsquo;t you please stay for
a second cup, and to talk to me a little of our
homeland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant stayed. They ended by talking little
of the homeland. In their strange surroundings
they found a fascinating subject of conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boy at last, who gave his
name as Kirk Munson, &ldquo;they are truly the
last of the Dons. Once a rich and noble
family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you know&rdquo;&mdash;his lips moved close,
he spoke almost in a whisper, &ldquo;there is a tale,
perhaps only a legend, a story of a beaten silver
box filled with priceless pearls taken from
the Pacific when that great ocean was young.
The silver box, so the story goes, was hidden
away by the first Don of this family to keep
it from the buccaneers, hidden and lost from
sight of human eyes, perhaps forever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are all sorts of caves and things
like that about here,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all
very mysterious and&mdash;and sort of bewitching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caves?&rdquo; said Pant, awaking to his most
urgent need. &ldquo;Are they near? Do you suppose
they are quite dark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am told,&rdquo; Kirk&rsquo;s voice was low again,
&ldquo;that there is a very great one not four miles
back in the bush, and dark. It is said you
are no more than inside it before you are
fairly immersed in darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very place!&rdquo; exclaimed Pant. &ldquo;I
must go there at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must you?&rdquo; Kirk&rsquo;s voice was full of surprise.</p>
<p>This changed at once to entreaty. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
you please let me go along? No one who lives
here will take me. I have a servant, a huge
Carib, a very giant of a man who will be our
bodyguard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Pant, rising. &ldquo;Be
glad for the company. But why do those who
live here refuse to enter the cave?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Haunted.&rdquo; The other boy&rsquo;s tone was impressive.
&ldquo;They say the cave is haunted by
the ghosts of more than a thousand Maya
Indians who are supposed to have fled there
from their enemies and to have perished centuries
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One wouldn&rsquo;t care to come upon their
bones in such a place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirk shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, shall we go?&rdquo; said Pant.</p>
<p>Kirk nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. We had better go up in the cool
of late afternoon. The jungle air will not be
so oppressive. We can return by the light of
the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Late that afternoon, after a day of rest, Pant
found himself on the broad veranda of the
house. Here he unbound his pack. From it
he took three light fibre trays, a package of
powders, two flashlights, extra batteries for
the lights, and his small black box. All these,
together with a quantity of matches, he bound
carefully in waterproof oiled cloth. He was
then ready for the journey to the cave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>As he sat for a time, waiting for his new
found friend, his mind was rife with speculations.
How had this strange American boy
come here so far from the seaboard? How
did he come to be in Central America at all?</p>
<p>The Spanish people were strange, too. He
had heard of them, the last of the Dons. Fragments
of their history had drifted to him from
afar. They were the direct descendants of a
proud Spanish family. Two centuries before
the family had grown immensely rich, so the
story ran. How had they come by their
wealth? Where had it gone? These were
questions no one seemed prepared to answer.
Enough. They were rich no longer. For all
that, they appeared to live very comfortably
off the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So there is a story, probably only a legend,
telling of a box of beaten silver filled with
pearls,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I must know more of
that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>He found himself far more interested in the
story of that large band of Maya Indians who
had perished in the cave. &ldquo;The thing must
have happened long ago,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did not enter the cave empty handed.
When people flee they take some treasures
with them. Should one come upon their bones
he would be sure to find priceless curios there,
beaten gold, hand cut stones and copper
knives of long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, he was interested in this a little, but
most of all he was concerned with his own
business within some dark corner of the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish he&rsquo;d come,&rdquo; he thought impatiently,
&ldquo;wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the hugest black man he
had ever seen, bearing in one hand a rifle that
was a veritable cannon and in the other a
basket, rounded the corner of the house. He
was closely followed by the American boy.</p>
<p>In a loose flannel blouse, corduroy knickers
and high stout boots, Kirk looked quite fit
and capable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready for any adventure,&rdquo; was Pant&rsquo;s
mental comment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I didn&rsquo;t tire you waiting,&rdquo; Kirk
smiled at him. &ldquo;The Spanish mother put up
a bit of lunch for us&mdash;casaba bread, home
made cheese, butter and wild honey. She insisted;
so did Ramoncita. They are dears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Real sports, I&rsquo;d say,&rdquo; Pant assented
heartily. He could scarcely remember a time
when the very mention of such strange and
tasty food did not whet his appetite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ramoncita?&rdquo; he said after a moment. &ldquo;Is
that the girl with round cheeks and big dark
eyes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Ramoncita Salazar. Musical name,
isn&rsquo;t it? The real Spanish people of the highest
class are wonderfully attune to all things
artistic and beautiful. But we must be off.
This black man will go along to help carry our
stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trail they followed was steep and rocky.
It was not much of a trail. In places the
bushes hung over it so thick and low that they
were obliged to all but creep on hands and
knees; again it was so smooth and steep that
only by clinging to low growing shrubs could
they go forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>For all that, there was something of a trail.
Here and there were suggestions of an ancient,
permanently cut way. In three places
Pant found his feet firmly planted upon steps
which had been cut from the solid rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stands to reason,&rdquo; he said as he perched
himself upon the topmost steps of the last
flight, &ldquo;that these were built by natives long
ago. See how nature has chipped and worn
the edges away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably done by the Maya Indians centuries
ago,&rdquo; said Kirk, dropping upon a soft
bed of moss and fanning himself with a broad
leaf pulled from a palm. &ldquo;Everything of importance
that is told of the Maya Indians happened
long ago. There are a few of them
back in the hills now. They do not count any
more. A nation that was once rich and in a
way powerful, that had a civilization rivaling
any to be found in the world five centuries ago,
has dwindled to a handful of vagabonds of the
jungle. It is sad.&rdquo; He cupped his chin in
his hands and, as if seeing the palaces and
temples of that lost civilization, sat staring
at the jungle. &ldquo;It is said,&rdquo; he went on at
last, &ldquo;that the cave we are about to visit was
the last hiding place of the smartest and
wisest of the Mayas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fleeing from the Spaniards?&rdquo; asked Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. The Spaniards have many atrocities
justly charged against them. But the great
Maya civilization was destroyed by fierce,
war-like tribes from the North before the
prow of the white man&rsquo;s boat touched Central
America&rsquo;s coral strands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last of the Mayas are said to have
fled to this cave and, unless they knew a secret
passage leading out of the cave, to have perished
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Pant thought of the ancient treasure
they must have carried with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the savage tribe follow them into the
cave?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They were afraid. That&rsquo;s the way the
story goes. Afraid the Earth God of the
Mayas would push the mountain down upon
them if they should enter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; thought Pant, &ldquo;whatever the Mayas
took with them is in the cave still. And they
were possessed of great wealth. I have read
of it. Gold and jade, topaz and perhaps diamonds,
pearls from the western shores and
strange little gods carved from rare stones
or formed from metal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this he thought, but not one word did
he say as they resumed their upward march.</p>
<p>The entrance to the cave, which they reached
after much climbing, was most picturesque.
Its mouth was entirely hidden by dark spreading
palm leaves. A sparkling stream, appearing
to emerge from nowhere, went dashing
headlong over a rocky ledge.</p>
<p>Parting the large leaves as if they had been
a curtain, the boys peered within to find there
a dark hole from which there came a constant
draft of cool damp air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boo!&rdquo; said Pant. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold in there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>The other boy did not hear him. He was
staring in amazement at his black servant. As
if seized by a sudden fit of ague, the giant
was shaking violently from head to foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A chill,&rdquo; said Pant as he caught sight of
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid,&rdquo; his companion whispered back.
&ldquo;Afraid of the Earth God of the Mayas. He
has great courage and the strength of three. I
have never known him to fear anything before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a moment it became evident that the
black man was ashamed of his fear and was
making brave attempts to conquer it. In the
end he won and, seating himself upon a rock,
watched his young master and Pant remove
their shoes and stockings. The narrow entrance
to the cave offered no footing save the
moss covered rocks at the bottom of the
stream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>As they signified their readiness to start,
the black lifted the door of a strange glassless
lantern of beaten brass which, Pant was
told, burned fish oil and would provide a feeble
light for hours on end. After lighting the
lantern he plunged boldly into the stream and
led the way through icy water straight into
the darkness of night until, with a grunt of
satisfaction, he emerged panting and dripping
upon a dry ledge where the cave suddenly
widened to a broad chamber.</p>
<p>For a time, lighted only by the dull gleam
of the Carib&rsquo;s lantern, they moved along the
brink of the narrow stream. The silence was
oppressive. The stream flowed placidly over
an all but level floor, making no sound. Only
the gentle pat-pat of their bare feet disturbed
the tomb-like hush that hung over all.</p>
<p>Then of a sudden, like thunder from a clear
sky, pandemonium broke loose. The innocent
cause of all the commotion was the Carib. He
had, by chance, struck his lantern against a
rock.</p>
<p>The air was filled with strange noises, such
a whirring and snapping as not one of them
had heard before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what is it?&rdquo; Kirk&rsquo;s hand trembled
as he gripped Pant&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bats,&rdquo; said Pant. &ldquo;Stand perfectly still.
They will settle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a single second he threw on his flashlight
and allowed it to play across the space
before them. The other boy&rsquo;s eyes went big
with wonder. Even Pant, who had seen much
of Central American life, was astonished.
Bats, a million of them it seemed, circled the
air. And such bats! No tiny mouse-like creatures
were these, but great gray monsters
with broad spreading wings, gleaming eyes
and teeth that shone white in the perpetual
night about them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Kirk&rsquo;s hand was on his arm. The
light flashed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May as well go ahead,&rdquo; said Pant. &ldquo;Doubt
if they go far back into the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>They had not gone a hundred yards before
they came to a very narrow passage. Once
more they were obliged to take to the bed of
the stream. This lasted only a moment. As
they emerged there came over them a sense
of vastness. Was it the quality of silence that
was there? Was it the changed sound of
their footsteps? Or was it some sixth sense
that told them? As Pant threw the gleam
of his powerful flashlight before them, an exclamation
escaped every lip.</p>
<p>Nothing they had seen in any land could
compare with the splendor of the masonry of
the vast cathedral that lay before them.</p>
<p>Masonry? This indeed they at first thought
it, the work of some great lost race. In time
they came to realize that the splendid gleaming
pillars were the work of time and a great
Creator, the Master Builders of all ages. The
pillars were great stalagmites, formed by the
dripping of water through a thousand thousand
years.</p>
<p>Strangest of all, as they listened they caught
from afar a sound that was like music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like some mighty organ played softly
while a thousand children chant,&rdquo; Kirk whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>It was now time to cover their feet, yet
even the Carib felt something of the awe that
led the others on, still barefooted.</p>
<p>The illusion of the chant could not last forever.
As they advanced the sound increased
in volume, became more distinct until it burst
upon them as the rush and roar of a miniature
cataract, where the stream emerged from a
chamber still beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we go on?&rdquo; Pant stood with his
feet in the lower water of the cataract.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If&mdash;if we don&rsquo;t get lost,&rdquo; the younger boy
hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance,&rdquo; said Pant. &ldquo;We have
only to follow the stream back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure. How stupid of me. Yes, let&rsquo;s
go on.&rdquo; There was an eager note in Kirk&rsquo;s
voice. Pant read it correctly. He was eager
to go forward for, in some hidden chamber,
perhaps just beyond, there might rest a vast
treasure from the forgotten past.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>The ascent of the water worn and slippery
rocks was difficult. More than once the
younger boy was in danger of being thrown
into the torrent of water, but drawn on by
Pant, lifted forward now and then by the
giant black, he made his way upward until
with a sigh of relief he dropped upon dry sand
at the head of the waterfall. Once more
Pant&rsquo;s light gleamed out before them. Fresh
marvels awaited them. A vast, silent underground
lake, reaching as far as the light would
carry and yet beyond, seemed to beckon them
on.</p>
<p>Switching off his light, that batteries might
be saved for a possible emergency, Pant followed
the Carib and his dim light along the
shore of this new marvel.</p>
<p>They had gone two hundred yards or more
when out of the darkness before them, on the
shore of the lake, something loomed indistinct
and gray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; The younger boy came to
a sudden halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; There came the snap of Pant&rsquo;s
flashlight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>The next instant, as if pushed by a sudden
force, they all fell back. Before them, drawn
up on the beach, with paddles crossed over
the seat, was a light canoe.</p>
<p>Staring with all their eyes, they stood there
expecting any moment to see the mysterious
canoeist emerge from the dim distance
beyond.</p>
<p>Not knowing what to think, Pant stood at
attention. As he did so, a strange chattering
struck his ears. Wheeling about, he discovered
the cause. The black giant&rsquo;s teeth were
chattering. Once more he was shaking from
head to foot. His face was almost white with
fear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III
<br />A STRANGE DARK ROOM</h2>
<p>Not knowing what else to do as he stood
before the canoe, Pant laughed. The laugh
did not ring quite true, but it served the purpose
for which it was intended. It broke the
spell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few strides and he stood beside the mysterious
craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dust,&rdquo; he said, dragging his fingers across
the seat. &ldquo;Probably been here for a hundred,
two hundred years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How wonderfully preserved it is,&rdquo; said
Kirk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Those people knew the secret of preserving
wood by boiling it in certain kinds of oil.
They knew a great deal more that might well
have been kept by the white man. But the
type of Spaniard who came to these shores,
as well as the wild barbarians who came before
them, were all for gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he stood there beside this strange underground
sea, with this relic of another age
so close beside him, Pant found himself lost
in revery. He was trying to reproduce through
his mind&rsquo;s eye the scenes that these silent
waters might once have witnessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a unique picnic ground,&rdquo; he said
to Kirk. &ldquo;One sees it still. Gleaming torches,
moving like giant firebugs across the
water; dark canoes gliding here and there;
the joyous shouts of children that came echoing
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello-o!&rdquo; he shouted suddenly. Back
across the water it came to him again and
again. &ldquo;Hello-o&mdash;H-e-l-l-o-o-o.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps there are fish,&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;May be very large fish. Blind, because there
is no need of eyes, but fine fish all the same.
Can you see them, the little Indian boys fishing
from their canoes? Can you catch the
gleam of their campfires as they roasted their
fish over the coals?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>He kicked the beach under his feet and
sure enough, from beneath the dust of centuries
he uncovered the ashes of a long burned
out fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;I am a conjurer. I
can read both the past and the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the other boy with a little
shudder and a doubtful smile, &ldquo;tell us what
happens next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next?&rdquo; said Pant. &ldquo;Why next we find
a small room equipped with a table and some
chairs. I have some work to do in such a
place, in fact that&rsquo;s what I came for. I needed
a dark room. But this,&rdquo; he spread his arm
wide, &ldquo;this is not a room; it is a whole hidden
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning without another word, the other
boy beckoned to the great Carib, who had
regained his composure, and together they
skirted the shore of the lake to penetrate deeper
into the hidden mysteries of the mountain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>Again the chamber narrowed. Again they
were obliged to take to the bed of the stream.</p>
<p>This time, to Pant&rsquo;s great joy, they emerged
into a small room walled and pillared in spotless
white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very place!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;To be
sure, there are no real chairs or table, but that
heap of fallen stalactites will take their place,
and there is water in abundance. Have a seat.
I will be through before you know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unwrapping his pack, he drew forth the
fibre trays. These he filled with water. Having
placed them upon a circular fragment of
stalactite that offered a level surface like the
top of a round table, he shook a powder into
one, a second powder into another, and left
the other crystal clear and pure.</p>
<p>After stirring the powder for a time, he
drew forth a red cloth and wound it twice
round the Carib&rsquo;s lantern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>The effect was startling. At once the glistening
white stalactites and stalagmites were
turned blood red. The Carib struggled hard
against the wild fears and superstitions within
him, conquered in the end, to sit impassive,
watching.</p>
<p>Opening his black box, Pant removed a
square of film. Having dropped this into the
first tray, he began rocking it slowly back and
forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A picture!&rdquo; exclaimed Kirk. &ldquo;Do you
mean to tell me you have come all this way to
develop a picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no other dark room. And besides,&rdquo;
said Pant, &ldquo;this picture is important,
the most important bit of work I have done
in a long time. Upon its success hangs my
good old grandfather&rsquo;s entire fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he went on, as he continued to
rock the tray, &ldquo;through influential friends
my grandfather secured a valuable concession,
the right to gather chicle on a large tract of
government land. This tract is bordered on
one side by the holdings of the Central Chicle
Company, a powerful and jealous corporation.
This company is honest, but perhaps they are
unscrupulous in their competition. Who can
tell? Perhaps they would drive my grandfather
to the wall if they could.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>Had not the red light hid it, he might have
seen a crimson flush suffuse the other boy&rsquo;s
face as he spoke these words. It was lost
upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our tract,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;is bordered on
the other side by land owned by an unscrupulous
Spaniard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We received a map from England
showing the boundaries of our holdings. It
had not been in the office a week when it was
stolen. Without it our hands were tied. If
we attempted to work our concession without
knowing the true unfenced boundaries we
were sure to infringe upon the rights of our
neighbors. If we did not they would claim we
had, and would ruin us with claims for indemnities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we did not have the map back within
a very short time&mdash;&rdquo; he paused to hold the
square of film to the light. A little cry of joy
escaped his lips. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming! I&rsquo;ve got
them! See those dark spots, three of them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>The other boy nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three men,&rdquo; he said impressively.</p>
<p>He dropped the film into the developing
bath to resume his story. &ldquo;I told grandfather
to wait, I would get the map. I went straight
back into the bush where the crafty Spaniard
has his camp. It was dangerous, but I know
the bush. I was careful. I took my camera
and a flashlight outfit with me. Fortune was
with me. I came upon the Spaniard and two
of his men examining the map at night. They
were inside a bamboo cabin. I put my camera
to a crack, opened the shutter, touched off a
flash, and at once was away. That is how I
came to the home of your Spanish friends.
That is why I am here. And there,&rdquo; he said,
holding the film by its corners, &ldquo;is the picture.
And it is far better than I hoped for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The film was indeed a strong and clear one.
The crafty faces of the Spaniards and the
square map stood out in bold relief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just a touch more,&rdquo; he sighed as he dipped
it carefully in the solution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he added in conclusion, &ldquo;all we
need to do is to get an enlargement made.
That will give us a perfect map showing all
the boundaries. What&rsquo;s more, it gives us
proof that they stole the map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad,&rdquo; said Kirk, &ldquo;that it was not
the big American Company who stole it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they wouldn&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said Pant
quickly. &ldquo;But why are you glad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other boy did not reply. A moment
of silence followed. Pant dropped his film
into the washing tray, then began rocking it
again.</p>
<p>Moments passed. Only the drip-drip of
water in some distant corner of the cave and
the all but inaudible rush of the stream disturbed
the silence of the place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Pant breathed at last as he
dropped the film into the fixing bath. &ldquo;We
can have more light now. How would you
like to take your man here and go into the
chamber just beyond while I finish this job?
No harm can come of it, and you might discover
something of real interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the younger boy hesitated.
Then, as if struck by a sudden thought, he
said, &ldquo;Yes. Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later Pant saw the shadows of
his two companions in adventure moving jerkily
along the gleaming walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like ghosts,&rdquo; he thought. Something
like a tremor ran down his spine.</p>
<p>He turned to attend to his film. When he
looked again they were gone. Instantly he
regretted his suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spooky business, being here alone in this
cave,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Dark and damp&mdash;sort
of like a tomb. Who knows how many human
beings have perished here? This cave
is their tombstone and their vault. How still
it is!&rdquo; Listening, he thought he heard his
own heart beat. &ldquo;What would I do if they
failed to return? Go in search of them, I suppose.
And then?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>He did not like to think of exploring the
place alone. All well enough with others,
but alone? Well, anyway, one likes company
in such a place.</p>
<p>The fixing bath was done with. For the
final washing he chose a still pool at the side
of the stream. As he dropped in the film, a
tiny fish, startled from its place of hiding,
suddenly leaped clear of the water. The effect
on the boy was startling. He jumped
backward, and nearly fell into the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he exclaimed, quite put out at himself.
&ldquo;How absurd! Nerves. Have to find
something to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having completed the washing of the film,
he fitted it into a protecting frame, then closed
two trays over it and bound the whole
tight. He finished by repacking the kit.</p>
<p>This done, he allowed his eyes to wander
here and there about the place. &ldquo;Have a
look,&rdquo; he told himself. Instantly some object
in a distant corner, quite well up on a broken
ledge, caught his attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Strange!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look
quite natural. Unusual color. Have a look.&rdquo;
He started toward the corner, then paused.
A curious tremor shot through him. It was
as if he had been on board a ship that had
rolled ever so lightly in a trough of the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Nerves.&rdquo;
He again moved toward the corner.</p>
<p>At that very moment, as often happens
when one stands facing some strange and
mysterious phenomenon, Pant thought of one
who was far away, his good pal Johnny
Thompson.</p>
<p>He thought, too, of the strange message of
figures and signs he had left in the office at
Stann Creek. He wondered if Johnny had
found it yet. If so, had he read it? Premonitions
of some happening tremendous and terrifying
were passing through his mind. If
disaster overtook him here, would Johnny decipher
the note? Would he come in search of
him? Would he ultimately find him? So his
thoughts whirled on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV
<br />JOHNNY THOMPSON IN JAIL</h2>
<p>It may seem a trifle strange that anything
could have separated these good pals, Johnny
and Pant. Fact is, only Pant&rsquo;s discovery of a
genuine blood relative, his grandfather, could
have brought about such separation. Pant of
course had become deeply engrossed in the
work of building up the fortune of his white-haired
grandsire. In this task Johnny had
shown a lively interest until the concession
with the priceless map enclosed had arrived.
From that time on, it had seemed, nothing remained
to be done save to round up a band of
chicleros and get back into the bush. There
a camp would be built and long weeks spent
in gathering and boiling down the sap of the
&ldquo;chewing gum&rdquo; trees. For this task Johnny
had no taste. He must have adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>So on that bright tropical morning, little
dreaming that the safe would be robbed that
night and that adventure would be provided
for all, he had cut himself a stout stick for
dealing with snakes, had strapped a machete
to his belt and had fared forth alone in search
of adventure.</p>
<p>Had Johnny lived in Honduras twenty-five
years, or even ten, he would have waited for
the train. It wouldn&rsquo;t go up for two days.
But always, to the Central American, there is
plenty of time.</p>
<p>But Johnny was new to the Tropics. He
was in the habit of taking the best transportation
he could get. The best this time was a
pair of short sturdy legs which belonged to
Johnny Thompson.</p>
<p>The road leads through a jungle. Here and
there is a small group of struggling, insignificant
banana plantations, but the jungle has so
far succeeded in taking them back to itself that
they, too, seem wild.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>There is a certain joy to be had from a journey
on foot through a tropical jungle. There
is a glimmer of green, a fresh damp odor of
decay, faint and pleasing as musk, and there
always comes from the bushes and trees a suggestion
of low, joyous music, made, perhaps
by bees and birds, but nevertheless it is there,
an indescribable music. Johnny had enjoyed
all this until he had begun to feel the need of
food and refreshment. Most of all, he wanted
a drink. Any old drink would do. But there
was no drink. The dry season was nearing
its close. Everywhere the floor of the jungle
was dry as the Sahara.</p>
<p>Had Johnny lived long in the jungle he
would have stepped aside to break the stem of
a certain plant, then to catch in the hollow of
his hand the delicious water that came dripping
out almost in a stream.</p>
<p>He hadn&rsquo;t lived long in a jungle, so all he
could do was to plod on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>When his desire for water had become intense
longing, when his tongue seemed to fill
his mouth and his throat clicked when he swallowed,
he had found himself by a sudden turn
to the right brought suddenly into the midst
of an orchard of fruit trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forbidden fruit&rdquo; is the name the natives
have given these great golden balls. Johnny
didn&rsquo;t call them that. He had called them
grapefruit. He hadn&rsquo;t eaten grapefruit many
times because he had found them bitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bitter!&rdquo; he had said, making a wry face.
&ldquo;Bitter, and me dying of thirst!&rdquo; At a distance
they had looked like oranges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh well&mdash;&rdquo; He had resigned himself to
his fate. &ldquo;Here goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had left the railway bed, then dropping
on the moss beneath a heavily laden tree, had
seized upon a great golden ball and had begun
tearing away its covering.</p>
<p>Having quartered the fruit, he had made up
a wry face and thrust a generous wedge into
his mouth.</p>
<p>Instantly the wry face had vanished. A
glorious smile took its place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad,&rdquo; he said, filling his mouth again.
&ldquo;Not half bad. Just need to get ripe, I suppose.
Sugar would be an insult to such fruit
as this. People in the States don&rsquo;t know what
it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had spoken to himself, but some one else
had heard, for from somewhere above him
there had come in a melodious voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you like forbidden fruit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I beg your pardon!&rdquo; Johnny was on his
feet at once. &ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean to steal. See
here, I&rsquo;ll buy a quarter&rsquo;s worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had looked up at the girl whose golden
hair, golden freckles and dark green dress so
completely blended with fruit and foliage that,
until now, he had not seen her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a donkey?&rdquo; There was a suggestion
of a laugh in the girl&rsquo;s tone. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
see any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why must I have a donkey?&rdquo; Johnny
looked his surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because we sell them by the barrel. Fifty
cents a barrel. Of course, for a quarter you&rsquo;d
only get a half a barrel. But even so, how
are you going to carry them?&rdquo; Shaking out
her dress and laughing the girl had dropped
to the ground.</p>
<p>Out of his little adventure in the grapefruit
orchard had grown a new enterprise. Johnny
suddenly decided to become a shipping agent.
Madge Kennedy, who had turned out to be a
Scotch girl, had insisted upon his accompanying
her to the house to meet her grandfather,
Donald Kennedy. The grandfather, a great
gray-bearded man with a store of knowledge
that could come only from long study and
many years in the jungle, had proven a find
indeed. Johnny did not soon tire of sitting
on the broad veranda of the long one-story
house, listening to the old man as he rambled
on about bananas and grapefruit, strange
tropical foods, Carib Indians, and the future
of their little Central American Colony.</p>
<p>It had not taken Johnny long to discover,
however, that these kindly people were really
almost paupers in the midst of their abundance.
Many carloads of the finest fruit in the
world hung ripe on the trees. Why was it
not being shipped?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>When he had pressed them for an answer
to this puzzling question, Madge Kennedy had
told him that the fruit company had refused
to accept their fruit. The reason, she supposed,
was that her grandfather had two
years before sold his crop to the owner of a
tramp steamer. The great East Sea Fruit
Company, which had a monopoly on the fruit
trade of Central America, did not wish competition,
and they took this method of punishing
her grandfather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say!&rdquo; Johnny leaped to his feet.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find you a ship. There&rsquo;s one anchored
off Belize now. Jorgensen is the captain.
He&rsquo;s anxious enough for a cargo. Came all
this way for a cargo of mahogany. The half-caste
Indian woodcutters are on a strike.
There is no mahogany to haul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Madge beamed upon him in sudden
excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; her smile vanished, &ldquo;I know
the ship. It&rsquo;s no use. We have only a third
of a cargo for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finish up with bananas,&rdquo; Johnny suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose bananas? Every grower has a
contract to sell only to the Fruit Company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a little time Johnny felt himself
baffled, defeated. Then of a sudden an inspiration
came. Many times he had watched the
loading of bananas off the dock at Stann
Creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six hands!&rdquo; he exclaimed excitedly.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! Six hands! We&rsquo;ll have a cargo
yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That very night, after telling Madge of his
grand plan, he started for Guatemala City to
see the man who owned the largest banana
plantation in Central America.</p>
<p>For some little time fortune smiled upon
him in his new enterprise. Arriving at Stann
Creek in the dead of night he found a sailing
boat preparing to leave for Porte Barrios. At
this port he caught a train for Guatemala.
High noon found him walking the streets of
that ancient and most beautiful city of Central
America.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>The city&rsquo;s beauty was lost upon him. His
thoughts were centered about one man, Don
del Valle, the richest banana grower in all
that land. He at once went about the task
of finding the man and securing an interview.
Having discovered the dapper, black-eyed
Guatemalan sitting in his garden sipping
wine, he wasted no time on ceremony but,
boy-like, launched at once into his project.</p>
<p>The astonished del Valle, who understood
only a part of what was said and who was
accustomed to inflict long periods of waiting
and numerous delays, stared at him in astonishment
for a time. Then he demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it that this mad boy wants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bananas! I want bananas!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, go and buy them, as many as
you like.&rdquo; del Valle threw a handful of coppers
at his feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I want many. Two-thirds of a ship
load, twenty thousand bunches.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s
face took on an air of unusual seriousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have no bananas to sell. They are
contracted for, as you should know, by your
great American company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not the six hands.&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed
eagerly. &ldquo;I only ask for six hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six hands!&rdquo; the Guatemalan exclaimed in
a fit of passion. &ldquo;Six hands! Here, take this
crazy youth to jail. I will prefer a charge of
annoying a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two native policemen, who were in
reality the official guard of the great gentleman,
sprang into action. Ten minutes later
Johnny found himself inside looking out, and
the window he looked through was heavily
barred. So it was that Johnny Thompson
came to be in jail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V
<br />TOTTERING WALLS</h2>
<p>It was at an early hour of that same night
that Johnny, having wakened from some
vaguely remembered dream, found himself
rudely shaken by a strange convulsion beneath
and about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ship&rsquo;s pitching something terrible,&rdquo; he
told himself. &ldquo;Must be a hurricane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ship?&rdquo; something within him seemed to
whisper. &ldquo;Ship? When did you embark
upon a ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vaguely he groped about in his brain for
facts. The sensations that come to one just
before he falls asleep are, more often than not,
awaiting him when he awakes. Johnny&rsquo;s had
remained with him. They were earth sensations,
solid earth, a place close and stuffy, and
stone, solid stone, not shifting sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>But there was now a strange rocking and
shuddering, no mistake about that. There it
was again! Zowie! What a lurch!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a ship at sea in a storm,&rdquo; he told
himself. &ldquo;No, not quite. More like a ship
stuck fast on a coral reef, being beaten to
pieces by the waves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought was startling. Again he attempted
to sit up. This time he succeeded.</p>
<p>Light streamed down upon him, moonlight
broken into little squares.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bars,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Prison bars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, now he remembered. This bed, not a
bed at all, merely a broad ledge of stone left
by the prison masons in lieu of a bed. Strange
sort, these Central American prisons!</p>
<p>Then, as if to refute all this, there came
again that horrible rocking shudder.</p>
<p>Struggling to grasp reality, Johnny&rsquo;s eyes,
roving the dark spaces about him, arrived at
the crisscross iron bars of the window. To his
vast astonishment he saw those iron bars, in
a solid mass, literally torn from the masonry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where I am,&rdquo; he told himself,
&ldquo;but I won&rsquo;t be there very long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With one thought uppermost in his mind,
that of escape, he leaped for the window,
gripped the sill, drew himself up, balanced for
a second there in the moonlight, then dropped.</p>
<p>He landed rather solidly, not upon the
tossing sea, but upon tossing dry land.</p>
<p>A moving figure loomed before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A guard!&rdquo; His quickened senses registered
the thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike first, and talk afterwards.&rdquo; His
head buried itself into the soft center of the
moving object. With a grunt the man went
down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>He wished the earth would stand still. It
made him seasick, that rocking motion. They
hadn&rsquo;t had a reason for putting him in prison&mdash;not
any real reason. He had done nothing
except insist upon buying twenty thousand
bunches of bananas. He had tried to do a great
service to a splendid old man and a beautiful
girl. He had reason enough for wanting
to be out of prison, plenty of reasons. There
was the girl, Madge Kennedy, back there in
the orchard of forbidden fruit, and her grandfather,
the aged Britisher who was so much
of a man and so little of a business man that
his orchards and banana plantations would
never make him a cent unless some one took
a hand. And there was old Jorgensen, good
old salt water skipper, walking his deck night
and day and staring gloomily at the Caribbean
Sea.</p>
<p>The earth stopped rocking for an instant.
An open court lay before him. He was beginning
to realize that he was having a new experience.
One of those frequent Central American
earthquakes had broken loose. That
was why a stone prison had seemed so like a
ship on a tossing sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open places are best,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>He had taken a dozen steps when there
came a shock which sent him down like a ten-pin.
At the same instant he touched an object
lying near him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>He found it soft and yielding. It was a
weeping child, a beautiful, black-haired, black-eyed
girl of seven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There now,&rdquo; he said, sitting up and talking
quietly to her. &ldquo;The storm will pass in
a short while. We&rsquo;re not shipping any water.
She&rsquo;s a staunch old barge. We&rsquo;ll weather
this little blow and never lose a mast or a
yardarm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the girl was unquestionably Spanish,
it seems probable that she understood not one
word that he said. She did understand the
steady comforting tone and the kindly touch
of his hand. She stopped crying, cuddled
down in his arms and, since it was now well
into night, she fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>As Johnny sat there, a motley throng gathered
about him. Like him, they came to this
open spot for safety. Some, like himself, were
fully dressed. Some were in pajamas. The
mild moonlight was kind to these last. Some
carried things in their hands, things they had
salvaged from the doom of their homes. A
parrot in a cage, an iron strong box, an alarm
clock, a broom; these and many more things,
somber, precious, ludicrous, had been brought
into the open plaza.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s mind began to travel back, to
gather up the slender thread of circumstances
that had brought him there. He traced it
thread by thread. &ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; he told
himself, &ldquo;will bring something quite new.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI
<br />AN EARTHQUAKE WITHIN A CAVE</h2>
<p>After leaving Pant to complete his photographic
work, Kirk and his giant servant had
passed from the small chamber to one very
much larger. He had taken one of Pant&rsquo;s
flashlights. As he sent its gleam down the
chamber he found it impossible to see the
distant wall. The ceiling was low, so low
that he was obliged to stoop at times to clear
it. The stalactites and stalagmites were
found in such numbers that they formed a
veritable labyrinth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mustn&rsquo;t go far,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Might
be difficult to find our way back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment, as his flashlight painted a
white avenue between two rows of natural
pillars, he caught a strange yellow gleam a
short way before him on the floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>A few steps and he was at the spot. His
hand was on the thing, an ornament of gold
of elaborate design, when his foot struck
something that crushed in like an ancient
gourd.</p>
<p>One horrified glance, and he sprang back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A skull. A human skull!&rdquo; he breathed.</p>
<p>One instant of horror, then he knew where
they were, or at least thought he knew. They
had found the final resting place of a race that
had vanished from the earth.</p>
<p>A moment&rsquo;s poking about in the dust convinced
him that this was true. Human bones
mingled with gold and silver ornaments, pots
of bronze, strings of jade beads, and who
knows what other priceless treasures from the
past, formed a setting for a bit of drama at
once shocking and intriguing.</p>
<p>Scarcely knowing what he was about, like
some child in Fairyland, he began gathering
up handfuls of the most attractive trinkets
and thrusting them into the deep pockets of
his knickers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>It was while he was engaged in this strange
occupation that he felt the same curious sensation
that had come to Pant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s like&mdash;&rdquo; His heart raced
wildly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if the world had tipped a
little!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly he heard the loud chatter of the
giant&rsquo;s teeth. In the midst of the chatter he
caught the sound of an attempted chant,
the Carib chant which they, in their darkness
of mind, believe will drive away evil spirits.</p>
<p>The boy gathered no other trinkets. A moment
passed, another and another. Every
tick of his wrist watch sounded out in the dead
silence of the place like the tolling of a funeral
bell.</p>
<p>Then, of a sudden, pandemonium broke
loose. The earth rocked. Huge stalactites
came crashing down, to roll about the floor
like barrels on the deck of a tossing ship. A
grinning skull rolled at his feet. With his
head in a whirl, Kirk knew not whether to
stand or to flee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The earth god of the Mayas!&rdquo; a terrible
voice sounded in his ear. It was the Carib&rsquo;s
voice. The next moment a powerful arm encircled
him and he was whirled through the
dark.</p>
<p>His senses reeled. Only dimly could he
realize what was passing. There was an
earthquake. He was sure of that. They were
common enough in Central America. They
had been caught in a cave while an earthquake
was in progress. What could be more
terrible? The big black man, ever faithful to
his trust, was attempting to carry him out.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Pant, who had mistaken the first strange
tilting of that portion of the earth&rsquo;s surface on
which he stood as no movement at all but a
break of the imagination based on unstrung
nerves, had moved with a rare showing of determination
toward the curious object which
lay on the rocky shelf. He had made it out
as a small chest some two feet long and a foot
deep. He had discovered that the top was
thickly encrusted with dust, but the sides had
the appearance of some beaten metal, stained
and corroded by age. This much he had
learned when the sudden shock of the earthquake
came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>If the first movement had seemed like the
sudden lifting of a ship by a heavy sea, the
second was like the shudder and crash of a
great ocean liner as she is thrown upon the
rocks in a mighty storm.</p>
<p>The first shock left him well nigh senseless.
The second brought reason back upon its
throne. He thought at once of his young companion.
He had brought him to this place and
somehow he must see that he escaped from
this awful thing that was going on.</p>
<p>Seizing his flashlight, he started forward.
At once he thought of his water-proof package
and of the precious negative it contained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I owe much to my grandfather. Can&rsquo;t
lose that,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>Groping his way back, he secured the package.
Then, turning his face resolutely toward
the spot where the other boy and his
black servant had vanished, he pushed forward.
He had gone a dozen paces, had barely
escaped being crushed by a ponderous pillar of
white crystal, when a sudden quake brought
him to his knees.</p>
<p>Instantly he was up and fighting his way
forward. And now his eyes fell upon the
opening through which his companions had
gone.</p>
<p>What was his horror when at that moment
there came a crashing and grinding sound,
dust filled the air until he could scarcely see;
yet through it all one fact stood out clear and
undisputable. The opening through which
the others had gone was closed.</p>
<p>Next moment some object hurtling at him
from the right, striking him squarely, sent
him crashing to earth. There, bruised, half
senseless, he all but gave himself over to
despair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>Through the moment of hopelessness which
overcame the boy shot one ray of light. This
light, shining brighter and brighter, brought
him courage to battle on. That light was the
sudden realization that God, the one true God,
the good, patient, just God, was still in his universe
and that He still noted the sparrow&rsquo;s
fall.</p>
<p>The instant this fact was established, the
boy&rsquo;s mind grew calm. One calm thought
led to another. What had struck him? Not
a rock. That would have crushed him. What,
then? What but a human being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The giant black!&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>At that moment he caught a wavering
gleam of light. It was in the direction of the
cave&rsquo;s entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The black,&rdquo; he said again. &ldquo;They escaped.
Thank&mdash;thank God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly he was away, following the light.</p>
<p>For a moment the rude shocks of the earthquake
were over. Aside from the debris that
had been scattered about, his progress was
unimpeded, yet he made no gain on the feeble
light that wavered on before him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t suppose that boy could travel so
fast,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>Instantly a thought set him shuddering.
Had the black servant, overcome by a terrible
fear of a heathen god, forsaken his young
charge? How was he to know? For a second
he hesitated, then redoubled his pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Overtake him and force him to go back,&rdquo;
he told himself. &ldquo;If&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hoped his fears were unfounded.</p>
<p>He came to the entrance of the great underground
lake chamber, had passed it in safety
and was skirting the shore of the lake, which
was recovering from a great agitation, when
the earth shudder began again.</p>
<p>Battling against the dizziness that seemed
about to overcome him, stumbling, all but falling,
he had fought his way forward until at
last the great bulk of the black man stood out
before him. Then, as the very universe appeared
to reel, a great tidal wave from the
lake came sweeping over him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>Strangely enough, at that moment there
came into his mind a picture of his grandfather&rsquo;s
face. He thought of the water-proof
package and the precious negative, and
gripped them tight.</p>
<p>The tidal wave receded. It did not return.
He found himself once more on solid ground
and close by, not twenty yards away, was the
black and his young master. This last onslaught
had been too much for the giant native.
His knees had given way beneath him
and he had slumped to earth, murmuring incoherent
things about the earth god of the
Mayas.</p>
<p>As for Pant and Kirk, they knew no fear
of Maya gods. They waited, and as they
stood there they felt the rude shocks no more.
The surface of the lake was again as placid
as a pond beneath a silvery moon.</p>
<p>They made their way forward in silence until,
with a little thrill of joy, the younger boy
gripped his companion&rsquo;s arm as he cried:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See! The light! The light of the moon!&rdquo;
It was true. They had reached the entrance.
A moment more and they were sitting in the
shadows beneath the palms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; said Kirk at last, drawing from his
pocket an object that gleamed in the sunlight.
&ldquo;A message from out the past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was indeed an interesting collection he
had gathered quite at random. A bracelet of
gold set with jade, a small bronze god, grinning
and terrible, a miniature silver goblet,
and some other bits of jewelry of such odd
design that one was not able to so much as
guess their purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometime,&rdquo; said Kirk, &ldquo;we will go back
for more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if you will ever enter that chamber
again,&rdquo; said Pant. &ldquo;I believe the earthquake
closed the entrance to that particular chamber.
But we will go back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, we will go back,&rdquo; he repeated a
moment later. He was thinking of the
strange chest that was all but within his grasp
when the earth shudder came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; said Kirk, &ldquo;we must go down.
Morning will soon be here. And think what
the earthquake must have done to the old
Don&rsquo;s castle! Come!&rdquo; he cried, shuddering
with a terrible apprehension. &ldquo;Our good
friends may be buried beneath the ruins of
their home&mdash;they may be dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Closely followed by Pant and the great
Carib, he sprang away down the ancient trail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII
<br />JOHNNY WINS A FRIEND</h2>
<p>Just as the first faint glow of dawn lighted
the shattered walls and yawning windows of
the ancient Guatemalan jail from which Johnny
Thompson had been so strangely released,
the Spanish child in his arms stirred, then sat
up to stare about her. At that moment a tall,
dark Honduran came walking rapidly across
the plaza.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don del Valle!&rdquo; Johnny started. This
was the man who owned a fifth of all the banana
land in Central America, the man who
had ordered him thrown into jail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What next?&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>Not knowing whether to break and run, or
stand his ground, he hesitated until the man
was upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; the man exclaimed. &ldquo;At last!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>Johnny was on his feet in an instant, prepared
for flight. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been looking for me,&rdquo;
his thoughts raced on. &ldquo;Now he&rsquo;s found me,
he&rsquo;ll find me another jail. He&rsquo;ll put me in. If
he can catch me. He can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Yet for the moment
he stood still. Why? Probably he did
not know why, but it was well that he did not
run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you find the child?&rdquo; This was
the question the dark-skinned del Valle shot
at Johnny. At the same instant the child
Johnny had protected during the terrifying
earthquake sprang into the Honduran&rsquo;s arms.
The man&rsquo;s tone was not harsh as it had been
the night before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why I&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny tried to think. &ldquo;I
really didn&rsquo;t find her. She found&mdash;that is,
we fell over each other, so we decided to camp
here until the earth began standing still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you, my young friend? You are in
jail. Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was in jail.&rdquo; Johnny felt a creepy sensation
running up his back. That had been
a terribly uncomfortable jail. &ldquo;The&mdash;the jail
wasn&rsquo;t safe,&rdquo;&mdash;his face twisted into a quizzical
smile&mdash;&ldquo;so I came over here to the plaza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke the child was pouring words,
soft melodious Spanish words into Don del
Valle&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; said the Honduran. &ldquo;I was
hasty. You should not have gone to jail. My
child here, who was lost from us in the catastrophe,
tells me you were her protector. You
have returned me good for evil. Pardon. You
wished to ask me something? Bananas, was
it not? You should know that I have no bananas
to sell, that they are all contracted for
by your American fruit company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s heart leaped. Luck was coming
his way. Providence had sent him an earthquake
to cast down his prison bars and a
child to plead his cause. Before his mind&rsquo;s
eye came the faces of good old Kennedy, of
Madge Kennedy and of Captain Jorgensen.
He might be able to help them yet. At any
rate he was not to go back to jail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he found himself
saying to the rich Spaniard. &ldquo;It is only
the six hands I ask. They are not contracted
for. Two-thirds of a ship load is all I need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Six hands you say.&rdquo; Don del Valle
stroked his beard. &ldquo;It might be arranged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are hungry!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;The walls of my house are cracked, but it
has not fallen. The great shudder is over,
please God. My servants have cleared away
the rubbish and put things to right. We will
have coffee and hot corn cakes in the garden.
After that we will talk of these six hands.
Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the way through streets strewn with
debris. The child, flitting back and forth like
a sunbeam, placed a confiding hand first in
Johnny&rsquo;s, then in her father&rsquo;s brown palm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>In spite of the havoc wrought by the earthquake,
Don del Valle&rsquo;s garden was still very
beautiful. The broken fragments of a great
flower-filled urn had been cleared away. Two
fallen trees still lay prone amid a blazing bed
of flowering plants. In the background, in the
midst of a luxuriant growth of strange tropical
and semi-tropical plants, a path led to
inviting realms beyond.</p>
<p>On a broad piazza they sat in rosewood
chairs around tables of solid mahogany,
munching hot corn cakes and sipping coffee.
There was Don del Valle and his wife, a very
beautiful Spanish lady. Besides Johnny and
the little girl, there were no others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is their only child,&rdquo; thought Johnny
as he noted how tenderly they cared for the
dark-eyed girl. &ldquo;What a privilege to show
her a kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The talk ran on about matters quite foreign
to business. They speculated regarding the
extent of damage done by the earthquake and
the area shaken by it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have you many earthquakes in the
United States?&rdquo; asked the lady.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have never experienced one before,&rdquo;
Johnny replied. &ldquo;Our land is very broad and
flat. It has little backbone. Mountains are
the backbone of the land. At times the backbone
appears to shake up a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes!&rdquo; said the Don. &ldquo;It is quite true.
Our land is very much backbone, almost nothing
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny was interested in everything that
these people had to say, but was very anxious
to get down to business. He had come to
purchase bananas, twenty thousand bunches
at least. There was need of haste. Skipper
Jorgensen&rsquo;s ship, the <i>North Star</i>, was lying
before Belize in British Honduras without a
cargo&mdash;at least it had been lying there three
days before. There was no telling at what
moment some one might offer him a cargo
of cocoanuts, chicle, mahogany or a combination
cargo of all. Then Johnny&rsquo;s chance of
helping Kennedy and his granddaughter by
getting off their year&rsquo;s crop of grapefruit
would be gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;would be
a great tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said his host, as the others
moved away and the servant disappeared with
the dishes, &ldquo;we may talk. We must make it
brief. I am a busy man. In this city I operate
two stores, a cotton mill and a warehouse. I
must find out at once the extent of damage
done by the shock. You want bananas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six hand bunches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes, you wish only the six hand bunches.
And how can you use six hand bunches?
The Fruit Company will never purchase them.
How can you hope to dispose of them? They
are not used. Either they are not gathered at
all, or they are given to the stevedores or are
cut up and cast into the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; said Johnny, leaning eagerly
forward. &ldquo;It was just because you do not
care for them, because you have no contract
with the Fruit Company to deliver them, that
I thought you would be willing to sell them
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sell them!&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s eyes lighted. &ldquo;I
could almost give them to you. Five cents a
bunch. That would pay for gathering and
bringing them to the wharf. But you?&rdquo; He
turned his eyes upon the boy. &ldquo;What will
you do with them? If the Fruit Company cannot
handle them, how can you?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he smiled, &ldquo;because you were
kind to my child, I like you. I do not wish
to see you cheat yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said Johnny, rising to pace the
stone floor. &ldquo;You grade your bananas according
to the number of groups on a stem.
You call those groups hands. For a bunch
having seven hands the Fruit Company pays
twenty-five cents; eight hands thirty-seven
and a half; nine hands or more fifty cents. If a
bunch has only six hands they will not buy
it. Is it not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Si, Si, Senor.</i> It is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are the bananas on the six hand bunch
smaller? Are they less sweet? Will they
spoil more quickly than those on the other
bunches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <i>Senor</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why are they not as good?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>The Spaniard shrugged his shoulders for
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are as good, exactly as good!&rdquo;
Johnny struck the table with his open palm.
&ldquo;Small bunches are a little more trouble to
handle. That is the only difference. There
are plenty larger. The Fruit Company takes
only what it wishes and reaps a rich reward
from this. But we will handle the six hand
bunches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In America,&rdquo; his tone became quiet,
&ldquo;there are thousands of poor people who
would gladly eat more bananas. Their children
love them. Do they eat them? No.
Why? Because, while you sell a bunch, one
hundred bananas, for a quarter, in the United
States one must pay a quarter for five.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be legitimate reasons for the
great difference in price. I am not going to
look into that. It is not my task. But for
once, in a little corner of our great country,
there will be cheap bananas. Six hand bunches.
You sell them to me for five cents a bunch
and I will do the rest. How many may I
have? Twenty thousand bunches?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five thousand, <i>Senor</i>. On my
three plantations there are this many small
bunches. You may have them all. I will give
you a note to my manager at Porte Zalaya.
He will have them brought to the docks at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In regard to the pay, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will pay when your people pay you
for the bananas,&rdquo; said the generous Spaniard.
&ldquo;Send me a draft. If the money does not
come to you, then it will never come to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I must go. Come
inside, and I will instruct my secretary about
the note you are to carry to my manager at
Porte Zalaya.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, stepping on air, Johnny
made his way toward the railway station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;if only I can
reach the <i>North Star</i> before Captain Jorgensen
contracts for another cargo, all is well. I&rsquo;ll
make it snappy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>He had not lived in Central America long
enough to know that in this little world of sudden
revolution and many strange surprises,
things are almost never done snappy. It is the
land of <i>manana</i> (tomorrow), a land where
nearly everyone believes that <i>manana</i> will do
very well for all &ldquo;snappy&rdquo; business.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII
<br />AN ANCIENT CASTLE IN RUINS</h2>
<p>The moon was still casting a golden glow
over the wonders of a tropical world when
Pant and Kirk, closely followed by the giant
Carib, emerging from the jungle caught their
first look at the last Don&rsquo;s plantation. With
eager eyes they sought out the spot where the
ancient castle had stood.</p>
<p>At a first startled glance Kirk cried out in
dismay. Little wonder this, for where a noble
edifice had stood a mournful sight now met
their eyes. The magnificent, century old castle
was now only a crumbled pile of broken
timber, tumbled stone and crumbling mortar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; Kirk cried. &ldquo;They are all gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be as bad as that,&rdquo; said Pant. &ldquo;At
the first shock they would run from the house.
Come on. Let&rsquo;s get down there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>No sooner said than done. Heedless of
sharp stones that cut their shoes and sharper
cacti that tore their flesh, they sprang away
over the intervening space that lay between
them and the tumbled pile of debris that had
once been a very happy home.</p>
<p>It was with a cry of great joy that Kirk
found his good friends, the family of the
last Don, gathered upon a little circle of
green that lay before the ruins.</p>
<p>After a quiet greeting befitting such a moment
of great sadness, the boys took their
places beside them.</p>
<p>It was a strange and moving sight that met
their eyes as they looked about them. Even
Pant, who had seen and experienced much,
felt a choking sensation about his throat.
Sprawled about upon the ground in various
attitudes of sleep were the servants. Not so
the family. The aged grandmother sat rocking
gently back and forth. The last of the
Dons, who had returned from a trip down the
river just in time to see his home crumble to
ruins, walked slowly before them. With hands
clasped behind his back, he paced ceaselessly
backward and forward in the moonlight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>Sitting beside the two boys, the dark-eyed
Spanish girl, granddaughter of the last of the
Dons, stared dreamily at the moon. To her no
tragedy could be quite complete, for was she
not young and beautiful? Was not all the
world fresh and new? Strong she was, too,
and brave. Many the jaguar that had known
the steel of her unfaltering aim, many the wild
turkey brought in by her to be roasted before
the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, and there was a note akin
to joy in her tone, &ldquo;we shall live like the
savages in a house of thatched bamboo.
Through the many cracks the morning sun
shall peep at us as we awake. The rain shall
fall gently upon our roof, the breeze shall play
with my hair as I sit in our little castle of
bamboo. The jaguar may look in upon us at
night and the little wild pigs go grunting
about our cabin. My good friend Kirk, and
my new friend Pant, we will live like savages
and life will be sweet for, after all, what is
so romantic as a little home in the midst of a
vast wilderness?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>Kirk smiled at her. He admired the courage
of this child of an old, long lost race.</p>
<p>As for Pant, he scarcely heard her. He was
thinking of the fragments of a tale that had
come to his ears, the tale of the first Don and
his box of beaten silver filled with priceless
pearls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been hidden in the walls of
that very building which the rude shock of
nature has wrecked,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;I
must have a look over those ruins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then perhaps,&rdquo; he thought more
soberly still, &ldquo;that may have been the box I
saw on the rocky ledge just as the earthquake
shook the world down upon my head.
I wonder if that passage was closed? If it
is not, was the box buried in the wreckage?
Who can tell? I must know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>His thoughts returned to the American boy
who had accompanied him, who now sat close
beside him. During the previous day he had
been taken to the boy&rsquo;s room. There he had
seen costly toilet articles, silver backed brushes,
real tortoise shell combs, and genuine alligator
skin traveling bags.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must belong to a rich family,&rdquo; he
thought. &ldquo;How then does he chance to be
here so far from the home of other Americans,
with only a black man as his companion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if reading his thoughts, the other boy
began to speak. &ldquo;My uncle,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has
travelled much. He wishes me to know the
world as he knows it. He is especially anxious
for me to know much of Central America
and her products. You see I am to be&mdash;&rdquo; He
paused, did not finish the sentence, stared
away at the moon for a moment, then said
quietly, as if the sentence he had not finished
had really never been begun, &ldquo;Uncle has had
but one rule in all his travels: wherever a native,
one who has always lived in the land he
is visiting, will go, he will follow. That is the
only rule he has laid down for me. My Carib
is a native of this land. You saw how wonderfully
he performed to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>Pant nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherever the Carib will go, I may
follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A question leaped into Pant&rsquo;s mind,
&ldquo;Would the Carib venture again into the fear
inspiring Maya cave?&rdquo; He doubted it, yet
he wished very much to return. He did not
wish to go alone, had hoped that his new found
friend might return with him. The story he
heard that night as he sat before the ruins of
that ancient home greatly strengthened his
determination to revisit the cave.</p>
<p>No place could be better fitted for the telling
of a tale of buccaneers and Spanish gold
than that scene of ruins beneath the golden
moon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>It was the last Don himself who told it. He
told it all in Spanish, with many a dramatic
gesture, but Kirk, who appeared to understand
Spanish as well as he did his mother
tongue, interpreted so skillfully that it seemed
to Pant that the aged Don, with his venerable
beard and coal black eyes, was telling the
story directly to him.</p>
<p>And this was the tale he told:</p>
<p>Soon after gold had been brought to Europe
from the New World and the rush for riches
had begun, Ramon Salazar, who had amassed
a comfortable fortune as a trader in old
Madrid, but in whose veins coursed the spirit
of the Crusaders, sold all his possessions and,
having invested them in trade goods, sailed
for America.</p>
<p>He landed on the east coast of Central America,
but soon made his way over the difficult
trail that led to the Pacific.</p>
<p>Ramon Salazar was a man of honor. He
did not go in search of Aztec gold, nor did he
lend aid to those shameful robberies of natives
that still lie black on the pages of Spanish-American
history.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Having made his way to the west coast,
where he hoped to be forever safe from British
and Scotch buccaneers, he set up a trading
post and prospered.</p>
<p>Having learned of the rich pearl fisheries,
he made a study of the matter and at last
fitted out a schooner for the purpose of pearl
fishing. Hiring divers and securing the protection
of a Spanish man-of-war, he lingered
long over those shallow waters whose submerged
sandbars were rich with pearl bearing
mussels.</p>
<p>He prospered again. Some pearls were sold,
but the richest and choicest were kept in a
box of beaten silver beneath the berth in his
own stateroom. The room was not left unguarded
night or day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some bright morning,&rdquo; Ramon Salazar
was fond of saying, &ldquo;I shall take that box and
sail away for sunny Spain. Then who cares
what further riches the New World may still
hold? But first,&rdquo; he always added, &ldquo;I must
have more pearls, larger pearls, a great pearl
of pearls.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>So he lingered, until one day a startling
thing happened. The east coast had long been
infested by buccaneers. The west had been
free. But now, out of a clear sky, one day
as Ramon Salazar dined with the commander
of the man-of-war, a boat load of marauders
boarded the pearl fishing schooner, overpowered
those on board, hoisted sail, and firing
a shot across the bow of the man-of-war,
they took to sea. And on board that schooner
was Ramon Salazar&rsquo;s treasure of pearls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of box was it that held the
pearls?&rdquo; Pant asked a bit breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my boy,&rdquo; was the old Don&rsquo;s reply,
&ldquo;that was long ago. Who can say? It was
of beaten silver, perhaps as long as a man&rsquo;s
forearm, and as thick as such a box should
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be the box,&rdquo; the boy thought to
himself. &ldquo;Surely I must return to the cave
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But to-morrow,&rdquo; he thought a moment
later, &ldquo;I cannot. There are other matters
which must be attended to. I must not forget
my grandfather, my photograph, and the
chicle concession.&rdquo; He felt for the packet
he had preserved so carefully. It was still
safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bloody marauders did not succeed.&rdquo;
The old Don&rsquo;s voice rose high pitched and
shrill. &ldquo;God confounded them. The man-of-war
fired a shot that snapped their mainmast.
They were captured. The treasure was restored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my sire of many generations back
fished for pearls no more. He took his box
of pearls ashore. He did not return to Spain
at once. Those were perilous times upon the
sea. He would wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He waited too long. Morgan came.&rdquo; The
Don was fairly shouting now. &ldquo;Morgan, the
most bloodthirsty and cruel monster that ever
sailed the Spanish Main. He came with many
ships and two thousand men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time after this he was silent. A first
faint flush of light along the fringe of palms
announced a new day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the aged man, speaking more to
himself than to them, &ldquo;Morgan did not get
the beaten silver box of pearls. Had he gotten
it, one must have known. He was a great
braggart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When my sire heard of Morgan&rsquo;s approach,
he put the box under his arm and
walked away into the jungle. He knew the
jungle well. He could not have gotten lost
in it. Yet he never returned. Somewhere&mdash;&rdquo;
He arose to fling his arms wide in a dramatic
gesture, &ldquo;somewhere in this jungle the box of
beaten silver with the wealth of every Salazar
within, lies hidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He resumed his seat. Light came more and
more. Exhausted, the ancient Don fell asleep.
But Pant stared at the dawn. He was thinking
of the time when he might return to the
Maya cave, and what he might find there
when that day came.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>And then, of a sudden, his thoughts took a
fresh turn. He smiled as he thought of the
strange code he had improvised at the spur of
the moment before leaving his grandfather&rsquo;s
office to plunge in the jungle, and the curious
note he had left for Johnny Thompson. Had
Johnny returned? Had he found the note?
Had he been able to read it? What had kept
Johnny so long? What was to happen? Were
their paths that had run side by side so long
to diverge at last?</p>
<p>Had he but known it, Johnny was at this
moment planning a task which was to bring
them close together, yet to keep them apart
for many days to come. Such are the strange,
wild chances of fate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX
<br />CREEPING SHADOWS</h2>
<p>Pant&rsquo;s wonderings about Johnny were not
misplaced. To dismiss one&rsquo;s good pal from
his mind is impossible. Johnny did not wish
to forget Pant. He had discovered his note
and found himself deeply concerned about it.</p>
<p>After leaving Don del Valle in Guatemala
City, he took a train to the coast. There he
caught a fruit boat to Stann Creek, and armed
with a note from Don del Valle to his plantation
manager ordering him to deliver twenty
thousand bunches of bananas to the bearer, he
reached Stann Creek just one hour before the
train was to start up the narrow gauge railway
to the Kennedy grapefruit plantation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>His first task was that of getting off a wireless
message to Captain Jorgensen offering
him a combined cargo of bananas and grapefruit
for his return trip to the United States.
With what feelings of hopes and fears he then
awaited the good skipper&rsquo;s reply. Now he
was elated by the hope that the <i>North Star</i>
was still at his service, and now cast down by
the fear that she was already loading mahogany,
dyewood or cocoanuts.</p>
<p>He was not idle, however. Having gotten
off his message, he hurried over to the office
which Pant had left some hours before. It
was with a deep feeling of unrest and disappointment
that he found the place deserted.
Colonel Longstreet had put the scattered papers
to rights and repaired the damaged safe
as best he could and he, too, had left. But on
the table, weighted down by a polished square
of ebony, was the curious note Pant had left.
Scrawled across the top by the trembling hand
of the old Colonel was Johnny&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was evidently intended for me,&rdquo; said
Johnny, &ldquo;but what in the name of all that&rsquo;s
sane does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some of Pant&rsquo;s doings,&rdquo; he grumbled as
with wrinkled brow he studied the miscellaneous
jumble of figures, question marks and
trade signs. &ldquo;Oh well, there&rsquo;s no time for
working puzzles now. I must get up the railway
to Kennedy&rsquo;s fruit farm. Won&rsquo;t they be
joyous!&rdquo; With that he thrust the paper in
his pocket, but it was not entirely forgotten.</p>
<p>He was in the curious day coach with its
seats along the sides and its broad open spaces
in lieu of windows, waiting for the train to
start, when he opened Captain Jorgensen&rsquo;s
wireless message.</p>
<p>His fingers trembled, his face grew sober as
he unfolded the bit of yellow paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no!&rdquo; With a quick exclamation of
joy, he read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Congratulations. The North Star awaits
your order.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be better,&rdquo; was the way the boy
expressed it as he walked among the gold
laden fruit trees two hours later. He was
talking to Madge Kennedy. No wall flower,
this girl. Sun-browned arms, honest freckles,
strong and healthy muscles, that was Madge
Kennedy. Though only nineteen years of age,
she had taken over the largest share of the
task of keeping the orchard in order.</p>
<p>Underbrush and creepers grow fast in this
warm, moist land. A constant war must be
waged against them. Johnny had found her
doing her bit by swinging a short stout brush
scythe. Two husky Carib Indians were working
with her, but Johnny noted with no little
pleasure that she was the best worker of the
three.</p>
<p>After taking the scythe and finishing the
swath, he dropped beside her in the evening
shade, and told her of his success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your grandfather&rsquo;s chance, and
yours,&rdquo; he said with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Think of
it! Five thousand boxes of grapefruit. That
many at least. And we&rsquo;ll get the top price.
America has never tasted such fruit. Your
grandfather has the boxes ready to set up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s nothing to stop us. Your
grandfather can find men to pick and pack
the fruit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carib Indians,&rdquo; she said in quiet confidence,
&ldquo;hundreds of them, thousands if necessary.
They love grandfather, every last one
of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, my friend,&rdquo; her voice was
husky, &ldquo;my grandfather is a sort of second
Livingston. Livingston went to Africa.
Grandfather came to Central America. He
has been all over it. There is no dark little
spot in any tiny republic where he has not
been. He has visited Maya Indians who were
supposed to kill a white man at sight. They
did not touch him. Love, sympathy and a
simple modesty are the charms that protect
him. There&rsquo;s not a family within the district
he has not helped in time of trouble. There
is always plenty of trouble. Oh yes, he can
find the men; without pay if necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be necessary. Do you know how
much five thousand acres of the finest grapefruit
in the world will bring in New York?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I. Thousands of dollars,
there&rsquo;s no question. Then your grandfather
and you can leave this wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave&mdash;leave it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s eyes swept the scene before her.
In the immediate foreground all green and
gold was the orchard; beyond that a broad
stretch of green where an occasional cohune
nut palm with leaves thirty feet long broke
the even green. Back of all that, nestling
against the vast, impenetrable jungle, was the
long, low house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Grandfather
would not leave it. He loves the land and
his black Caribs too well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He left it once.&rdquo; Her voice grew husky
again. &ldquo;War. He left then. He was gone
three years. They made him a captain. They
say it was uncanny the way he led his men,
his black Caribs from Central America, and
how in every bloody battle he escaped unharmed.&rdquo;
She was silent for a moment. The
shadows deepened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she went on softly, &ldquo;he
never speaks of it now. And he never allows
anyone to call him Captain Kennedy. That&rsquo;s
what he was, you know. But somehow I love
him a lot more for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got company!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
springing up and shaking herself as if to
break a spell that had come over her. &ldquo;One
of those dark Spaniards. I don&rsquo;t like him.
Br-r-r-r! He makes me think of the wolf in
Little Red Riding Hood. But we must go in.
It isn&rsquo;t respectable not to. He&rsquo;s been talking
some sort of business, but must be
through by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business?&rdquo; Johnny had the question on
his lips, but did not ask it. He was destined
in good time to know what sort of business
that was, and to get little enough comfort
from the knowledge.</p>
<p>They found Kennedy sitting alone on the
veranda.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Kennedy,&rdquo; said
Johnny, putting out his hand. &ldquo;Congratulate
me. I have my cargo completed. Bananas.
You may begin packing your fruit to-morrow.
It will be in New York within ten days if we
have luck. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke short off. A tall Spaniard had
emerged from the shadows. He had heard
all, and the black cloud on his face was not
all due to his dark Spanish skin.</p>
<p>He did not speak to the boy, but turning to
Kennedy bade him good-night, then strode
rapidly away to the spot where his saddle
horse was tethered.</p>
<p>It was astonishing, the effect of this man
upon Johnny&rsquo;s spirits. It was as if threatening
shadows had begun to crawl upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he whispered to himself. &ldquo;Probably
never see him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this he was wrong. He was destined
to see him many times, in fact to see him the
very next day, and to get a decided shock
from the encounter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Business,&rdquo; he whispered to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of business?&rdquo; He thought of
Madge Kennedy and the Spaniard, then dismissed
them from his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit here with grandfather,&rdquo; he heard the
girl saying. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have some food ready in a
jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mechanically he sat down, and as he did so,
discovered that the sudden night of the jungle
had blotted out every track of the orchard,
the wide spreading green and the dark forest
that lay beyond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X
<br />CAMP SMOKE</h2>
<p>While searching among the ruins of the old
Don&rsquo;s castle early that morning, Pant found
an ancient field glass that had by some chance
escaped destruction. A clumsy model it was,
and of such ancient design that it might well
have been a present from Queen Isabella to
Columbus. It was a powerful one, for all
that, and would serve his purpose well. The
old Don readily consented to loaning it.</p>
<p>With this new treasure in his pack, Pant
struck off toward the hills. He had gone a
short distance when disturbing thoughts came
to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something may happen to my film,&rdquo; he
told himself. &ldquo;I must not forget.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>Not willing to depend entirely upon memory,
he took sheets of paper from his pack
and stuck four of them together with the
sticky juice of a wild vine. Painstakingly he
traced as well as he could the outlines of his
grandfather&rsquo;s concessions and of the rival
companies, as shown by the film. Having
done this, he rebound his pack and continued
on his upward journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon,&rdquo; he thought as he traveled on, &ldquo;perhaps
to-morrow, we may begin operations.&rdquo;
He had a glorious mental picture of the light
on his grandfather&rsquo;s face as he saw a hundred
Caribs at work on their concession and saw
in it a promise of a rebuilt fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chicle gathering,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;What
a strange way to amass a fortune! Yet how
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he closed his eyes he saw the work begun.
The Carib Indians&mdash;great bronze men,
one time cannibals, now partially Christianized
and caught in the spell of white man&rsquo;s
influence, had always been friends of his
grandfather, as they had been of Kennedy
and of every true man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The old Colonel will appeal to them,&rdquo; he
thought to himself. &ldquo;They will respond.
They will flock to his banner. A hundred,
two hundred strong, shouldering axes and
machetes, they&rsquo;ll march into the jungle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had a mental vision of what would follow.
In the heart of the jungle a camp site
would be chosen. Palms would be felled, rude
shelters would be formed. After this the real
work would begin. Scattering out through
the jungle, the Caribs would search out the
largest, most promising sapodilla trees.
These, by the aid of their bare toes and a
single strap, they would scale to a distance
of thirty or forty feet. Beginning at the top,
working their way round and round the
trunk, they would cut in the bark a spiral
groove reaching to the ground. Down the
groove sap from the bark would ooze. When
a sufficient quantity had reached the canvas
sack placed at the bottom of the groove, it
would be collected and carried to camp
where, in a huge copper kettle over a great
fire that blazed merrily, the sap would be
boiled down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>When the chicle had cooled, it would be
kneaded like bread dough until it was thick
enough to form in cakes. Then it would be
poured into moulds and allowed to harden.</p>
<p>After that, packed two cakes in a gunny-sack,
it would be carried on Caribs&rsquo; backs to
the nearest stream. By pit-pan to the sea,
then by sailing schooner to the nearest shipping
point, Belize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;our work is done.
The Central Chicle Company will take it off
our hands. They are the real exporters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His heart warmed as he saw the long rows
of black and brown men and seemed to catch
their weird chant as they marched on the first
lap of the long journey with the freshly gathered
chicle on their backs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will succeed,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;We
must!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>One other thought came to him at that moment,
a rather vexing thought. He would
return to the Maya cave. Sooner or later he
would go back and enter in search of the mysterious
metal box he had seen there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I should find the beaten silver box,&rdquo;
he said to himself, &ldquo;if the pearls should still
be within, after all these years, to whom would
they belong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finders keepers,&rdquo; an old adage, kept running
through his mind. Yet this did not quite
satisfy him. This problem was soon dismissed
from his mind. He had business before him.</p>
<p>He had reached the rocky crest of the hill
that lay at the back of the old Don&rsquo;s pasture.
From this promontory one might command
a view of the valley below and might trace
the course of its main stream, the Rio de
Grande, for a distance of thirty miles.</p>
<p>Hardly had he reached this observation post
and spread his crude map out before him, than
the smoke of a score of campfires rose lazily
up from the jungle valley some ten miles
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s well within our territory,&rdquo; he said
with a start and an exclamation of anger.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Diaz. He has already begun operations
on our trees. He is very bold. He takes
too much for granted. But we&mdash;we&rsquo;ll show
him!&rdquo; He clenched his fists hard.</p>
<p>But what was this? Off to the right,
scarcely three miles distant, a second smoke
rose above the tree tops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can that be?&rdquo; he asked himself. At
once his mind was in a whirl. That it was
not a second group of Diaz&rsquo;s men he knew
well enough. Men in the jungle always huddle
in one group. Perhaps it is fear of that
unknown peril that lurks in the jungle that
causes them to do this. Who can say?
Enough that this is a custom of the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it be that the Central Chicle Company
is also poaching on our ground?&rdquo; he asked
himself. &ldquo;It does not seem possible. And
yet, who else can it be?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must know,&rdquo; he resolved. &ldquo;I will see.&rdquo;
At that, following the bed of a stream, he
struck boldly down through the jungle toward
the spot where the first camp site
smoke still rose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>For two hours he fought the jungle. Scrambling
down a water drenched ledge, battling
the clinging bramble, creeping low beneath a
growth of palms, and racing down the trunk
of a massive fallen mahogany tree, he forced
his way forward until he found himself on
a steep ledge looking upon the winding sweep
of the river.</p>
<p>Here he paused to stare in astonishment.
Less than a year before a mahogany company
had logged a wide strip next to the river. The
jungle had not yet retaken the clearing. In
the midst of this cleared space, some hundreds
of yards apart, stood two bands of men. Axes
flashed from their shoulders. Here and there
the two foot blade of a machete gleamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;why it&rsquo;s as if they were lined up for
battle! Who can they be?&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s
breath came short and quick. He took the
old field glass from his pack and focused it
upon the two groups of men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>The band over to the right were of mixed
lineage, some Spaniards, some half-castes,
some blacks. He could guess this from their
postures and the garments they wore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diaz,&rdquo; was his mental comment. &ldquo;But
the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tall, thin man, wearing a khaki suit and
a helmet, stood out before the others. Unquestionably
he was a white man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the others are Caribs.&rdquo; A thrill shot
up the boy&rsquo;s spine. The distance was great.
At that distance it was difficult to tell, and
yet&mdash;</p>
<p>His field glass was now riveted upon the
white man in the khaki suit. He was evidently
speaking to a leader of the other group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s throat tightened.
&ldquo;And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;&rdquo; The white man threw
up his arms in a gesture of impatience. There
was no mistaking that gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather, the old Colonel!&rdquo; The cry
stuck in the boy&rsquo;s throat. What was he saying?
The distance was too great to hear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>As the boy stood there silent, watching, his
knees trembled and his head whirled. The
thing that had happened was evident. Having
grown impatient waiting for Pant&rsquo;s return,
the old Colonel had gotten together a band
of Carib chicleros and had gone into the
jungle to gather from the narrow stretch of
land which he knew to be his. He had happened
to stop near the crafty Spaniard&rsquo;s illegal
camp. The two bands had met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; the boy told himself with a
shudder, &ldquo;there will be a fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fight? What did that mean? Certainly
terrible bloodshed. Between this half-caste
band and the Caribs there had always been
waged a sort of gorilla warfare. Now here
they were face to face, a hundred men on
either side. Armed with axes, machetes and
revolvers, they would do terrible execution.
It would be a battle to the death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must get down there. I have the picture
of the map,&rdquo; the boy told himself. &ldquo;That
may help. I must be beside the old colonel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>He paused for a moment&rsquo;s thought as to
how the affair was likely to end. A mile of
tangled brush lay between him and them.
Could he reach the spot in time?</p>
<p>As if to answer his question, the white and
brown line, Diaz&rsquo;s men, suddenly began
marching straight on toward the lone white
man who stood out before the Caribs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late!&rdquo; The boy all but sank upon the
ground. Yet, getting a better hold upon himself,
he stood there wide-eyed and terrified.</p>
<p>Never had he witnessed a thing so strikingly
dramatic as the deadly regular march of
those men. And never had he seen anything
so heroic as the image of the aged colonel
standing there erect, silent, motionless, facing
them all.</p>
<p>Sixty seconds passed, the men had covered
half the distance. Ninety seconds; they were
very near. A hundred; they were all but upon
the silent figure. Still with arms hanging motionless,
he stood there. It was a tense moment.
The boy ceased breathing. Standing
there, leaning far forward, he thought a
prayer, that was all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>But what was this? At some call from the
side, all faces turned right. The marching
column broke step, then came to a dead halt.
As they did so, erect, with head held high,
a stately figure rode in before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old Don, the last of the Dons!&rdquo;
Pant breathed. &ldquo;How strange!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To all appearance the aged Spaniard began
to speak. The others paused to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&mdash;now is my chance!&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s
mind worked like a spring lock. &ldquo;I may make
it yet.&rdquo; At once he dropped over the ledge
and made his way down the perilous cliff until
at last he reached the tangled mass of vegetation
that lay at the foot of the rocky ledge.</p>
<p>Battling now with all his might, heedless
of brambles that tore at his clothing, of stinging
palm leaves that cut his face, and the
ooze of the lowlands that threatened to engulf
him, expecting every moment to hear the war
cry of the Caribs, he fought his way through.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>He will never know what the aged Don
said to the Spaniard, Diaz, and his mixed band
of chicleros, yet he will never think of the Don
and his speech without experiencing anew a
deep feeling of gratitude. For it was that
speech which, beyond a shadow of a doubt,
saved his grandfather&rsquo;s life. Had the fight
ever begun he would have been the first to
fall, for he was well in advance of his men,
and was not the man to turn his back to the
enemy.</p>
<p>As it was, when puffing, perspiring, bleeding
from wounds inflicted by the jungle, the
boy burst into the clearing, he found the aged
nobleman, the last of the Dons, speaking
calmly to the men and the men of both camps
as calmly listening.</p>
<p>What was there about this aged Spaniard
to inspire such calm? Was it his venerable
appearance? Was it that he was of noble
birth? Who can say? So intent were the
men upon his words that Pant was able to
slip unobserved to the old colonel&rsquo;s side and
to explain in a few well chosen words just
what the film he held in his hand meant to
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>His grandfather&rsquo;s face lighted with a smile
not soon to be forgotten. He spoke quietly
to his foreman:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the men to withdraw after the speech.
There will be no fighting, no fight, do you
understand? We have found a better way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Word was quickly passed down the line.
The loyal Caribs stood ready to obey.</p>
<p>As the old Don ended his speech with a
bow of his venerable head, Pant pressed forward
to grip his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will never forget.&rdquo; He repeated the
words in Spanish. &ldquo;Never forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The aged Spaniard bowed and smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>A moment later Colonel Longstreet was
speaking to the crafty Diaz. His words were
few and well chosen. He would withdraw his
men if need be. There would be no fight. He,
Diaz, might gather all the chicle he chose to
in that valley. One thing he must remember,
however; the real owner of the concession was
in possession of an exact reproduction of the
stolen map. Not alone that, but he had positive
proof that he, Diaz, stole the map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positive proof!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;And remember,
the profit on every pound of chicle
you gather on our territory must be paid to
us. The law of the land is just.&rdquo; With these
words he walked away.</p>
<p>No smoke arose next morning over the spot
where Diaz&rsquo;s camp had stood. Diaz and his
men had returned to their own narrow boundaries.
Yet Diaz was not through contesting
the rights of an American to gather chicle on
the upper reaches of the Rio de Grande. He
had lost one battle, but others were to follow.</p>
<p>There had been rain during a previous
night. Now, as if to prove that nature and
the fates were on the side of Pant and his
recently discovered grandfather, there came
a perfect deluge of rain. Rain is indispensable
to chicle gathering. Now the work could go
forward at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI
<br />BATTLING AGAINST ODDS</h2>
<p>In the meantime Johnny Thompson was
allowing no grass to grow under his feet.
Having arranged with Kennedy to put his
fruit on the wharf within five days, he secured
the services of a wheezy but dependable motor
boat and started at once to Porte Zalaya, the
headquarters of Don del Valle&rsquo;s banana growing
company.</p>
<p>He arrived at three o&rsquo;clock that afternoon,
and went at once to the long low office building
at the end of the wharf. There he asked
for Armacito Diaz, the manager.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>Johnny did not know that Armacito Diaz
was the same Spaniard who had been doing
his utmost to defeat Pant in his work of rebuilding
his grandfather&rsquo;s fortune. For reasons
best known to himself, though possessed
of concessions of his own, Diaz played the
part of a humble servant under the employ of
Don del Valle&rsquo;s direction. He was the same
man who had given Johnny the black look at
Kennedy&rsquo;s. Since the valley of the Rio de
Grande was only a short distance off, he had
ridden to his chicle camp, there to meet
temporary defeat in his attempt at looting the
old colonel&rsquo;s concessions. Fox-like, he was
now in his den behind clouded glass walls, administering
the affairs of the banana planter.</p>
<p>A dapper Spanish clerk took Johnny&rsquo;s message,
then disappeared through a door at the
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will see you in a minute,&rdquo; said the
polite clerk.</p>
<p>Johnny sat down on a bench to wait. The
day was warm. There was no breeze. The
bench was hard. The minute grew into a half
hour, an hour.</p>
<p>Johnny rose to inquire patiently regarding
the impending interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One minute.&rdquo; The clerk was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One minute. Just one more minute and
he will see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another hour passed, a precious hour to
Johnny. He rose once more; but this time,
ignoring the clerk, he threw back the swinging
gate, strode across the narrow enclosure,
threw open the door at the rear and entered
the room beyond.</p>
<p>Imagine the surprise and shock that awaited
him when he found himself face to face with
the frowning Spaniard of the previous night,
the man Madge Kennedy had said was like the
wolf in Little Red Riding Hood.</p>
<p>The man sprang from his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senor Diaz?&rdquo; said Johnny in as easy a
tone as he could command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You intrude,&rdquo; said the other without answering
his question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are Armacito Diaz,&rdquo; said Johnny,
looking him square in the eye, &ldquo;I have a right
to intrude. I have a message from your master.
You have delayed its delivery unnecessarily.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>To himself Johnny was saying, &ldquo;This man
Diaz? Here is a nice mess. He already dislikes
me for some reason or another. Perhaps
I am in his way somehow. Perhaps, like
many Spaniards, he hates all Americans.
However that may be, he will do his master&rsquo;s
bidding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; The frown on the Spaniard&rsquo;s
brow deepened as he read the message
Johnny laid before him. &ldquo;Gather twenty
thousand defective bunches for shipment?
What nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are Diaz?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Diaz. And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny Thompson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;American.&rdquo; There was contempt in the
man&rsquo;s tone. &ldquo;Adventurer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;American,&rdquo; said Johnny quietly. &ldquo;As for
the other, it matters little to you whether I
am or not. You will deliver the bananas at
the dock, this dock, to-morrow morning; at
Dock No. 2 the next day; and at No. 3 that
same night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The order is forged,&rdquo; said the manager,
throwing the letter on the table. &ldquo;My master
would have no part in such nonsense. Twenty
thousand defective bunches!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six hand bunches,&rdquo; corrected Johnny
quietly. &ldquo;The order is not forged. You
know it is not. Ignore it at your own risk.
Your position as manager is at stake. You
will send your men into the field at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Manana</i>. To-morrow,&rdquo; said the manager
after several moments spent in thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible. The men are scattered.
We have on hand no more loading for ten
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then to-morrow. To-morrow
evening we will be at this dock ready to load.
We can load at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this the Spaniard made no answer.
After waiting a respectable time for a reply,
Johnny left the office.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>As he walked out into the warm tropical
sunshine his head was in a whirl. The feeling
of dark shadows creeping up from behind him
was so strong that he involuntarily turned to
look back. There was no one. The dusty
street was empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;that he should
seem to hate me and want to thwart my plans.
He seems to be a friend of Kennedy. He must
know I am working only for Kennedy&rsquo;s good.
Why then should he behave as he does?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was destined to ask that question many
times before he discovered the real answer.</p>
<p>Just then as he thrust his hand deep in his
pocket, a habit he had when engrossed in
thought, he felt a crumpled bit of paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pant&rsquo;s message,&rdquo; he said to himself as
he drew it forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what it&rsquo;s all about?&rdquo; His brow
wrinkled in puzzled thought. &ldquo;Wish I knew.
Wish I had the key to it. It might mean a
lot. Wish I knew where he is, and what&rsquo;s
happening to him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>Finding a grassy spot in the shadow of the
dock, he sat puzzling over that jumble of
figures and signs which he felt sure was
meant to convey an important message to him,
but which in reality meant nothing to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The key!&rdquo; he exclaimed at last in disgust.
&ldquo;If only I had the key to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The key to this riddle, if only he could have
known it, lay back there in the little bamboo
office where Pant had left the note. He had
expected Johnny to sit right down beside the
portable typewriter and study out the meaning
of his strange cipher message.</p>
<p>As it happened, there had not been time for
this; a great pity, too, for the message was an
important one. Its solving at that moment
might have saved Johnny many a heartache.
Without the typewriter, however, it was going
to be difficult, very difficult indeed. In
the end he pocketed the message still unread.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>There is only one silence more complete
than the silence of the jungle at mid-day.
That is the silence to be experienced at the
heart of a great banana plantation in the heat
of the day. There not a twig drops but its
fall is heard. The march of a thousand ants
going and coming over their tiny paths gives
forth as definite and distinct a sound as the
tramp of an army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>Johnny was hearing and watching these
toiling ants. He got scant comfort from these
observations. Their actions reminded him
of three days of painful failure. The <i>North
Star</i> was at loading dock No. 1, had been for
three days, yet her hold was as empty as the
day she had tied up there. There were no
bananas at the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here there are plenty,&rdquo; Johnny told himself,
glancing up at the three great bunches
that hung directly over his head, and away
at hundreds on every hand.</p>
<p>Again his attention was drawn by the rustle
of rushing ants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;It would
take a million of these ants to weigh as much
as I do, yet they are getting on with the thing
they wish done. I have failed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>He started. The thing the ants were doing
was quite like the work he wished to do.
They were tearing bits of leaves from a vine
and were carrying them away beneath the
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as a hundred men should be carrying
bunches of bananas to our ship,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we have no bananas,&rdquo; he grinned in
spite of himself. All about him were bananas,
a vast unending sea of them, a hundred thousand
bunches. He had been promised twenty
thousand. That treacherous Spanish manager,
Diaz, had blocked his every move. Not
a bunch had he delivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Manana! Manana!</i>&rdquo; He had whispered
over and over. &ldquo;My workmen are scattered.
They have gone turtle hunting. They are
not here. To-morrow they will be back. To-morrow.
To-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo; the boy exclaimed. &ldquo;When
I get back to the States I shall have that word
removed from the dictionary.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>Suddenly his lips parted, but no sound came
forth. Rising upon one knee, he crouched
there poised like some wild creature ready for
a spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that a voice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt reasonably sure of it, yet in this land
of monkeys, parrots and mocking birds one
could never be quite sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;if they are that
crafty Spaniard&rsquo;s men sent to hunt me down,
there may be a fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;why should he
wish to hunt me down, to have me killed?
He&rsquo;s having his own sweet way. What more
could he wish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought of the man sitting there on the
veranda with Kennedy, thought too of Madge
Kennedy. Madge Kennedy of the golden hair
and frank freckled face, the bright, alert, clean
Scotch girl of the jungle, and for some reason
or another his brow clouded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a fight they want,&rdquo; he said, clenching
his fists tight, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re quite welcome to
it, though I&rsquo;d be the last to start it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>Having caught no further sound, he settled
back to his task of watching the ants stowing
away bits of leaves, and of thinking over his
own problems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if they were hurrying through with
an important task,&rdquo; he told himself, watching
the tiny workers with renewed interest,
&ldquo;as if they were preparing for some great
change, perhaps some gigantic natural catastrophe,
an earthquake, a storm, a&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder&mdash;&rdquo; his brow wrinkled as he
gazed away toward the western sky. But no,
there were no clouds, only a faint haze that
spread over all the sky, faintly obscuring the
sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing much I guess. Getting superstitious,&rdquo;
he told himself. &ldquo;Must be going
back. But not just yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had come to the heart of this banana
plantation for two reasons. He had wanted
to carry on a little investigation of his own,
and to think his problems through.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>The investigation had confirmed his suspicions.
There were no workmen in this field.
Diaz had said there were fifty men here gathering
bananas. He had promised that the
fruit would be at the dock, a train load of it
next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A plain out-and-out lie!&rdquo; Johnny told
himself bitterly. &ldquo;He knows he has me defeated.
Any untruth will do. To-morrow my
option on the <i>North Star</i> expires. Then she
will steam away. After that Kennedy&rsquo;s grapefruit
may rot on the dock. He will be worse
off than before. His Caribs have gathered and
packed the fruit and there will be no money
to pay them. What a blunderer I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was all quite true. The sleek, soft spoken
Spanish manager of the plantation had, after
that first stormy meeting, seemed to suddenly
become quite friendly. He had invited Johnny
to lunch and had feasted him quite royally.
He had promised that his men who were out
setting nets for turtles would be called in.
Johnny should dock his ship. The bananas
would be ready next evening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>That had been the first day. At the end
of the second day no bananas had appeared.
Johnny had sought out the Spaniard. He had
treated the boy to a sumptuous dinner and
had assured him that to-morrow the men
would go for bananas. &ldquo;<i>Manana, manana</i>,&rdquo;
he had repeated, wringing the boy&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>If only Johnny had been able to read Pant&rsquo;s
note! But he had not.</p>
<p>Captain Jorgensen had waited patiently for
three days; then, having been offered a cargo
of chicle and cocoanuts in Belize, he had given
Johnny notice that if bananas were not coming
aboard by the evening of the next day, his
option would expire and he would be obliged
to steam away.</p>
<p>He had said all this in the kindest tone possible.
He liked Johnny. He liked Kennedy
and his granddaughter, and would do anything
within his power, but the company that
owned his ship would stand for no further
delay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, quite all right. Very fine,
Senor, very fine,&rdquo; Diaz had said when, in despair,
Johnny had sought him out once more.
&ldquo;To-day my men are among the bananas. To-morrow
morning you shall have a train load.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny had doubted his word. He had
trudged away up the narrow gauge railway
track to see. He had tramped for miles in the
shade of great spreading banana plants and
had not seen a workman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not here, will not be here. We
will have no bananas. To-morrow the <i>North
Star</i> sails away. My plan fails. I have been
worse than useless to my friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he said doggedly, &ldquo;there must
be some way out. There must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again his eyes followed the long procession
of ants. Once more he glanced toward
the sky. The veil over the sun had grown a
shade deeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are hurrying faster than ever,&rdquo; he
said as he again watched the interesting procession.
&ldquo;It is as if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>Once more his thoughts broke short off.
This time from just behind the second row of
banana plants he felt sure he had caught the
low murmur of voices.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, at this moment when he
crouched there, nerves tense, eyes and ears
alert, watching for the mysterious unknown
ones, there flashed before his mind the picture
of a short stout white man standing at the
foot of a dock. He had seen that man only the
day before.</p>
<p>There was a mystery about that man. Who
was he? Whence had he come and how? No
steamers had arrived from the States. Yet he
was unmistakably American. His clothes were
well tailored. He had the air of one who is
prosperous and who finds himself often in a
position of authority. What could be his business
in Central America?</p>
<p>The first time Johnny had seen him he had
been standing at the foot of the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all the world as if some strange magic
had sent him, bone dry and all spick and span
right up out of the sea,&rdquo; the boy told himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>This mysterious American had gone directly
to the office of Diaz. When he left
that office a half hour later Diaz had accompanied
him as far as the door. There had
been a smile on the crafty Spaniard&rsquo;s face; not
the sort of smile one loves to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That smile,&rdquo; Johnny now told himself,
&ldquo;should have been enough to warn me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a rumor afloat that the prosperous
looking American was some high official
of the Fruit Company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is true, he may be behind my defeat,&rdquo;
he told himself. &ldquo;But one never can
tell. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused. His heart skipped a beat. From
close at hand there sounded a heavy footstep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diaz&rsquo;s men,&rdquo; he thought, slipping his machete
half out of its scabbard. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll find
I can fight if that must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant a figure loomed before him,
a great black giant with the face of a south sea
cannibal, and a smile&mdash;well, such a smile as
one sees only in tropical lands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>As the man saw Johnny, he turned half
about to speak to some one behind him. The
language he used was strange to the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two of them,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>But somehow his fear was gone. That smile
was disarming. The next instant Johnny
smiled. He laughed out loud, then leaped to
his feet to stretch forth both hands in greeting.
For the person who moved up to a position
beside the towering black Indian was none
other than Madge Kennedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, how did you find me?&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed
when greetings had been exchanged.</p>
<p>Madge turned to the Carib. &ldquo;These people
who have lived here always know everything.
He brought me here. But why did you hide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t, exactly. I came here to get the
truth. Having gotten it, I remained to digest
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you enjoy it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly.&rdquo; His tone was dubious. &ldquo;I
suppose you know I&rsquo;ve played my last card,
and lost?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guessed it. I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s tone was deep and mellow, like
the low note of a cello.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;but only sorry for
you, you and your wonderful old grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For us?&rdquo; She let forth a merry little
laugh. &ldquo;We shall get on, one way or another.
One always does down here you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is rather bad, though,&rdquo; she admitted,
sitting down upon the ground. &ldquo;You see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused to glance away at the sun.
Where the sun should have been, there was no
sun, only a dull, veiled sky. Her brow
wrinkled, but she did not comment upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is bad,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;We may have
to sell the orchard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sell the orchard!&rdquo; Johnny was surprised.
&ldquo;To whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diaz.&rdquo; She leaned far forward as she answered.
&ldquo;He wishes to buy it. That was
what he and grandfather were talking about
when you came the other night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Diaz!&rdquo; Johnny took in a long breath.
The picture of the stout, prosperous American
and the crafty Spaniard passed before him.
&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s his game,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got
Kennedy in a hole. The sale of his grapefruit
would let him out. Diaz is determined to
block the shipment, and is in the position to
do it. The scoundrel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Spaniards down here don&rsquo;t love us,
the English and Scotch, too much,&rdquo; Madge
Kennedy went on. &ldquo;The trouble goes clear
back to the days of buccaneers and the Spanish
Main. The English and Scotch logwood
gatherers drove the Spaniards from the mouth
of the Belize River. They have never forgiven
us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;they trade with us
when there is a profit to be made, but after all
their knife is always near our throats. Diaz
thinks he has us and he means to do his worst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have to sell to
the Spaniards. It will break grandfather&rsquo;s
heart. He wouldn&rsquo;t mind if it went to a fellow
countryman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; she reminisced, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s been
our land longer than I can remember, much
longer. It&rsquo;s our home. Don&rsquo;t you see, Johnny?
It&rsquo;s the only home I&rsquo;ve ever known. You
don&rsquo;t like to see your home sold to some one
you don&rsquo;t like, do you? Your home is part of
you. When you sell it, you sell part of yourself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have been all right if it hadn&rsquo;t
been for the Panama disease. Our land was
all in bananas then, and grandfather was getting
rich. We had bananas like these.&rdquo; She
spread her arms wide. &ldquo;Better than these.
Then the disease came. Plants wilted like
flowers before a hot wind. It wasn&rsquo;t long before
there were no bananas. Along the Stann
Creek railroad they used to gather twenty-five
thousand bunches a week. Now they don&rsquo;t
get twenty-five hundred.&rdquo; She sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather was cheerful even then. He
always will be. He&rsquo;s a sport, a great big good
sport with a soul.&rdquo; The tones of her voice
grew mellow and deep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He planted grapefruit. You know the
rest. And now, now I guess we&mdash;&rdquo; Her voice
broke. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Johnny sprang to his feet. There
came a roar as of rushing water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Only look!&rdquo; There was awe in
Johnny&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Madge turned pale. The top of a palm tree,
left for some unknown reason to grow among
the bananas, was writhing and twisting as if
in mortal agony.</p>
<p>At the same instant the entire broad sweep
of banana plants moved forward to bow low
as if in obeisance to some god and, caught by
a terrific onrush of air, the three of them,
Johnny, Madge Kennedy and the Indian, were
thrown in a heap against a stump.</p>
<p>Madge scrambled to her knees, rubbed her
eyes, stared away at the sky, then said in a
tense, scarcely audible whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;May God protect us! It is to be a tornado!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br />DESTRUCTION</h2>
<p>Banana land is never fully cleared before
planting. Great giants of the forest, mahogany,
nargusta, black tamarind, Santa Maria,
and many other great trees are girdled and
left standing to rattle their dry and leafless
limbs like bones on a gibbet to every wind that
blows. In the time of a great wind such as
often sweeps across the Caribbean Sea, dead
limbs of girdled trees and the ponderous
fronds of palms come crashing down upon the
less stalwart banana plants.</p>
<p>It was on such a half cleared plantation that
Johnny Thompson, Madge Kennedy and the
giant black Carib Indian found themselves
when the storm came tearing in from the sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>That they were in a tight place Johnny
knew right well. He had heard of these tropical
storms. Many an old timer had told him
of braving them upon sea and land. Travelers
in this land are told in awed tones strange
tales of terrific gales.</p>
<p>Johnny shuddered as he heard the crack and
crash of giant trees torn and tortured by the
wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; he said to the girl.
&ldquo;Can we get out of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; She spoke slowly, deliberately, as
one may who knows her land and its storms.
&ldquo;The tossing banana plants will shut off the
roads. Some will fall, blocking the way. The
wind will increase in violence. The storm will
last for hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must find shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shook her head. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
As if determined to destroy them, the palm
sent a second discarded frond sailing toward
them. It fell with a crash that brought down
a dozen banana plants with it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>Madge shuddered.</p>
<p>The currents of winds above them seemed
greater than those that agitated the banana
plants just over their heads. Great dead trees
writhed and tossed as if in terrible agony,
while from here and there at a distance there
came the crash of one that had been broken
off or uprooted.</p>
<p>Of a sudden the force of the winds appeared
to double in volume. At the same instant
Johnny saw a great black mass come leaping
toward him. Powerless to move or speak for
a second, he saw the thing leap straight at
him. Giving up hope, he shut his eyes.</p>
<p>There came a deafening crash. A sharp
quick cut across the face brought him to himself.
He leaped to his feet. The wind caught
him and threw him violently. His senses
reeled. The thing was too monstrous. What
had happened? His face was bleeding. He
did not feel it. His senses were benumbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must act!&rdquo; he told himself savagely.
&ldquo;Something must be done. There is the girl.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>He had succeeded in coming back into control
of his senses when something hurtled past
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Carib,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;No, the
girl!&rdquo; He had caught the flash of her blue
dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the Carib and the girl.&rdquo; He realized
that the aged black giant had seized the girl
in his arms and was battling his way straight
into the teeth of the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can he hope to do?&rdquo; he asked himself
as, first on hands and knees, then crouching
low, on his feet, he struggled forward in
their wake.</p>
<p>Dimly, he became conscious of the thing
that had happened. A great sapodilla tree,
uprooted by the storm, had pitched straight at
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten feet nearer and we would have been
killed,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the black bulk
that leaped at us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>The thing the Carib was doing puzzled him.
He was fighting his way over broken branches
and beneath threatening trees. At last, finding
himself at a branchless trunk, and seeing
his way blocked by a tangled mass of vegetation,
he held the girl in one arm while, apelike,
he climbed to the prostrate trunk, then
against the terrific force of the gale battled his
way to the shelter of the roots of the giant
tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What strength!&rdquo; thought Johnny. &ldquo;What
magnificent power!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was content to creep the length of the
log, to come up panting beside them. Not a
word was said. The din about them was deafening.
The howl of the wind, the crash of
breaking, falling limbs, the groan of tortured
trees, all this was enough to inspire silent awe.</p>
<p>A moment they rested here. A moment
only. Then, at the Carib&rsquo;s sign, they slid off
the log to battle their way around the up-ended
roots.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>Johnny saw the Carib suddenly disappear.
He saw a chasm yawning before him; saw the
girl leap. He followed her, landing with a
shock that set his teeth rattling, then became
conscious of the fact that the storm was not
cracking about his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Storm cellar provided by nature,&rdquo; he
thought. It was true. The chasm left by the
tree roots was ten feet deep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gabriel thought of it,&rdquo; said Madge. &ldquo;It
is his country. He is very old. He always
knows the right thing to do. Isn&rsquo;t it grand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny thought it a little more than grand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We British and you Americans,&rdquo; she said
slowly, &ldquo;think we are very smart. We know
many things. But the natives of other lands,
they know many useful things that we never
dreamed of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are hurt. Your face&mdash;it is bloody.&rdquo;
Her eyes grew suddenly large.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I guess not. Nothing much. It must
have been the branch of that fallen tree. Lucky
it didn&rsquo;t kill us all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>The wound, little more than a deep scratch,
was soon dressed. Then, against the sheltered
side of the &ldquo;storm cellar&rdquo; left by the tree roots,
they sat down to patiently await the passing
of the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting worse. Listen!&rdquo; Johnny whispered
as the wind whipped the dead branches
with increasing fury.</p>
<p>The girl shuddered. &ldquo;The bananas,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;They will all be down. Ruined. The
whole plantation. There will be no more for
nine months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s the end of our plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, Diaz had us blocked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever think,&rdquo; the girl said after a
while, &ldquo;that even had you succeeded in loading
the bananas and grapefruit you might
have been worse off than before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? The ship&rsquo;s all right. Isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but at the other end? Did you never
think that an organization like the Fruit Company,
powerful enough to control the purchasing
of all fruit of Central America, could control
the selling market as well. Do you think
a big commission merchant would dare purchase
your load of bananas and grapefruit?
Could you deliver to him regularly? You
couldn&rsquo;t. What could he do if the powerful
Fruit Company should refuse to sell to him
because he bought from you? Not a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny was stunned. He had not thought
of this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; said the girl in a very quiet
tone, &ldquo;while it was brave and generous of you
to try to help grandfather and&mdash;and me, after
all it was just as well that nature and Spanish
trickery took a hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; said Johnny grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to have the chance at it, even now. I&rsquo;d
risk it. I&mdash;why, I&rsquo;d hunt up my old friend
Tony, the push-cart man, if necessary, and
I&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;Tony, I have a ship load of fruit at
half price down at the dock. Go tell your pals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a half hour&rsquo;s time there would be a mile
of push-carts coming my way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; he said slowly, almost despondently,
&ldquo;this is the end.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>In this he was mistaken. It was scarcely
the beginning of what was to prove a thrilling
adventure. &ldquo;The <i>North Star</i>!&rdquo; he exclaimed
suddenly. &ldquo;She was tied to the dock. What
will happen to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the girl did not know the answer, she
did not reply.</p>
<p>A moment later, the Carib crept up the bank
of the pit to disappear into the storm. Ten
minutes later, when he reappeared, his jacket
was filled with cocoanuts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Food and drink,&rdquo; smiled Madge. &ldquo;We
shall not fare so badly in our cave, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still the wind raged on. Rain came and
with it night.</p>
<p>A great flat boulder, turned half over by the
uprooted tree, left a sort of narrow grotto
with a stone floor. By crowding well back
into this grotto, Johnny and the girl were able
to escape the terrific downpour of rain. The
Carib, who minded a wetting about as much
as a duck, sat chuckling to himself beneath
the tree&rsquo;s great roots.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>For a time the girl and the boy talked of
many things, of their homes, of their native
lands, of strange customs and stranger laws,
of the sea and of the land.</p>
<p>The conversation turned to chicle gathering.
Then it was that Johnny told of his
friend Pant, how he had found his long lost
grandfather and how they were, beyond doubt,
at that very moment gathering chicle in the
forest around Rio de Grande.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rio de Grande!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl.
&ldquo;Diaz gathers chicle there. He will stop them
if he can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diaz!&rdquo; came from Johnny. &ldquo;He has a
hand in everything down here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he said a moment later, &ldquo;I
have a queer sort of message from my pal here
in my pocket. It&rsquo;s all done in figures and
signs. How he could expect me to read it is
more than I know. And yet, somehow I feel
that it must be important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I can help you. Let me see it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>Johnny drew the crumpled bit of paper from
his pocket, smoothed it out on his knee, then
gave it to the girl.</p>
<p>By the light of a tiny flashlight, which
Johnny always carried, she studied it for a full
three minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is queer,&rdquo; she said at last, twisting
her brow into a puzzled frown. &ldquo;But somehow
it seems easy enough if only one knew
how to begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For three minutes longer, as the wind sang
across the top of their grotto and the rain
came dashing down, she studied that bit of
paper. Then of a sudden she asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, how does your friend end his
notes to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Johnny thoughtfully, &ldquo;he
hasn&rsquo;t written me many. Near as I can recall,
when he comes to the end he just stops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s laugh rang out high and clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean does he say, &lsquo;Yours truly,&rsquo; &lsquo;Your
pal,&rsquo; or something like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s answer was prompt. &ldquo;He
always says &lsquo;Good luck&mdash;Pant.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; The girl gave a sudden excited
jump that brought a shower of small
rocks down from above. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! See!
Now we are making progress. See! This hyphen
stands for g. Those two nines for double
o, percentage sign for d, and so on. I know
now. This was written on a typewriter, one
of the little portable kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Johnny, beginning to see the
light. &ldquo;What a chump I am. Can you make
it out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can,&rdquo; she cried excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t just yet. Let me think. Your
typewriter is one of those small portable affairs
that fold over and fit into a black case,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me think. I learned the touch system
on one of those. Let me feel it out. Got a
pencil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny produced a stub of what had once
been a pencil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>Turning the note over, the girl began drumming
on it with all her fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if she were playing a piano,&rdquo; thought
Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; She put down a figure. &ldquo;And
there!&rdquo; she set down a sign.</p>
<p>So at last she filled the back of the sheet
with figures and signs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we can do it,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
all quite simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would seem so,&rdquo; said Johnny skeptically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really is, only you must know the position
of numbers, letters and signs on your
typewriter keyboard. If you had studied it
out before your typewriter it would have been
simple in the extreme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your typewriter has three shifts; one for
letters, one for capitals and one for figures and
signs. The thing Pant did was to lock his
machine for figures and signs, then write his
note as if the machine were set for letters.
Now I have worked out the location of letters,
figures and signs by memory and the touch
system, it will be very simple. The figure 5
stands for t, the percent sign for d, and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>For a little time longer she studied. Then
on a second scrap of paper she wrote the following,
which was Pant&rsquo;s note to Johnny,
written many days previous:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Johnny:</p>
<p>The map is gone. The Spaniards have
it. I am going into the jungle after it. I
will get it, never fear. Look out for a
Spaniard named Diaz. He is a Devil.
Never trust nor believe him for a moment.</p>
<p class="center">Good Luck,</p>
<p class="jr1">Pant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;So that was it,&rdquo; Johnny said thoughtfully.
&ldquo;They stole his chart. I only hope he got it
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then after a time, &ldquo;Well, I wish you had
seen that note sooner. I did trust Diaz. I
did believe him. That was a great mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still the wind howled and the rain came
beating down upon a plantation where thousands
of banana stalks lay on the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII
<br />A THOUSAND PEARLS</h2>
<p>Pant&rsquo;s knees trembled a little as his feet
splashed in that bubbling stream that coursed
its way through the dreadful Maya cave. It
had been strange, the entering of this supposedly
haunted cave, with companions. How
much more awe inspiring to be entering it
alone!</p>
<p>He wondered about those companions of
that other adventure. Who was this son of a
rich man? What had brought him into the
jungle? Where was he now?</p>
<p>As these and many other questions crowded
his mind, he made his way cautiously through
the outer passages to find himself standing
once more on the shore of that curious inland
lake which had filled their minds with curiosity
on that other visit and so inspired them
with fear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>He found everything as it had been. The
placid surface, sending back a glowing reflection
of his light, broke into a thousand ripples
as he waded knee deep in its icy waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clear,&rdquo; was his mental comment. &ldquo;Can
see my toes. What a marvelous reservoir for
supplying a city&rsquo;s drinking water! What a
pity there is no city near!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had waded back to the glistening sands
of the beach when, of a sudden, he found his
being vibrant to a great expectancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can it be?&rdquo; he asked himself. Instantly
the answer came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The canoe! The canoe on the shore,&rdquo; he
told himself. Strange how one&rsquo;s nervous system
responds to outer things that his mind
does not recall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of course,&rdquo; he assured himself as he
neared the spot, &ldquo;the thing won&rsquo;t give me the
shock it once did. We know now that it has
been there for two hundred years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wha&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>His gaze covered a space far in advance of
him, many yards beyond the spot where the
canoe had stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; he muttered, stopping dead in his
tracks. &ldquo;The canoe is gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who can say which shock was the greater,
the first sudden discovery of the canoe that
other time, resting on the beach of this underground
lake, or the present astonishing revelation
that had come to him?</p>
<p>For a moment he experienced great difficulty
in restraining his feet. They appeared
ready to carry him back to the entrance.
Something within him, an echo of the ancient
superstition of his ancestors perhaps, seemed
to be insisting that after all this cave was
haunted by the spirits of beings who perished
long ago and it was they who had ridden away
in the mysterious canoe.</p>
<p>For a moment he wavered. Then reason
triumphed. &ldquo;It was Kirk,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;He has returned with his giant Carib, and
for some reason or another has rowed the
canoe to some other part of the lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only question is, would the thing float
after all these years?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;they did not row
it away. That giant of his may have put it
on his back and carried it outside. What a
treasure for some museum of antiquity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thought that some one had been in the
cave since he left it was disturbing. Could it
be that Kirk and his Carib, or whoever it may
have been, had made a thorough search of the
place and had carried away the box of beaten
silver.</p>
<p>His heart sank at the thought and he hurried
on, reproaching himself for having waited
so long before returning.</p>
<p>Yet he had been needed every moment at
the chicle camp. It was a great season. The
trees were prime, the rainfall abundant. He
and his grandfather, with the faithful Caribs,
had been working day and night. One long,
low, palm-thatched shed was already piled
high with bricks of chicle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;By and by the season will end, then we
will have won,&rdquo; he told himself not realizing
that the chicleros&rsquo; battle is never won until
his bricks of chicle are aboard a steamer bound
for the United States. Then, and not till then,
are his worries at an end.</p>
<p>Pant had dared snatch a day for this adventure.
And here he was. Hope vied with
fear for a place in his heart as he hurried over
the sand toward the entrance to the treasure
chamber that might yield a great fortune or
offer blank and broken walls to his eager
searching gaze.</p>
<p>He climbed the water washed rocks with his
heart thumping lustily against his ribs. He
entered the small chamber above with the feeling
of one who enters some ancient temple at
night.</p>
<p>With one quick swing he swept the walls
with his keen eyes, then with a low murmured,
&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; he sank upon the wet rocks.</p>
<p>Courage and hope conquered disappointment.
Rising to his feet, he found himself
ready for a more thorough search.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>Back behind a tumbled pile of broken bits
of rock, thrown in a heap by the earthquake,
he caught the dull gleam of some object that
was not rock.</p>
<p>With breathless eagerness he attacked the
jagged pile. Ten minutes later, with a cry of
triumph on his lips, he lifted the beaten silver
box from its hiding place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Still locked.
Scarcely a dent in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holding it before him, he shook it vigorously.
A rattling sound was the response.
His heart raced wildly.</p>
<p>Mopping the perspiration from his brow, he
began studying the fastenings that held the
cover to its place. There were seven of these.
Six were mere clasps that lifted in response to
a pry of his clasp knife blade. The seventh, a
true lock, resisted vigorously. A sharp blow
from the small axe that hung from his belt,
severed this and the lid flew up, to reveal such
a glistening nest of pink, blue and white pearls
as is given to few eyes to see.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pearls!&rdquo; he murmured, scarcely daring to
believe his eyes. &ldquo;A thousand pearls. A
king&rsquo;s ransom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then chancing to remember a story he had
read as a small boy, he said, &ldquo;I wonder if
they will turn to rough stones and worthless
leaves when I reach the sunlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This thought troubled him little. The
pearls were real enough. Once the six clasps
were back in their places, he felt sure enough
of being able to bring the box and its contents
to the light of day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when I have done this,&rdquo; he thought to
himself, &ldquo;to whom will they belong? To me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This problem he considered long and earnestly.
The land on which he had found this
treasure was wild and rough. No one laid
claim to it. But there was the story of the
first Don and his beaten silver box of pearls.
Was this the box? Were these the pearls?
Did they belong by direct inheritance to that
last of the Dons who lived now at the foot of
the mountain?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seems probable,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;But
after all,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;the real question
now is not their ownership, but how are they
to be brought safely from this heart of a jungle
to the centers of civilization where a thousand
pearls may be offered for sale in safety and
with a reasonable hope that one may find a
buyer. The old Don could never do this. It
must be my task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having come to this conclusion, he bound
the box in a stout brown canvas bag he had
brought for the purpose, then began retracing
his steps over the way that led to the outer
air and sunshine.</p>
<p>Hugging the treasure, he made his way into
the chamber of the underground lake. Many
and strange were the sensations that passed
over him. At times he seemed to hear the
cry of terror that escaped the giant Carib&rsquo;s
lips as his mind became possessed with fear for
the earth god of the Mayas. Unconsciously
he found himself looking back, as if expecting
to be followed and overtaken by some unseen
force that would wrest the treasure from him.
Such was the spell of the Maya cave.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>At times he fancied that the earth beneath
his feet was beginning to tremble and shudder
as once it had. He redoubled his speed.
But in the end, he knew that this was pure
fancy. The water that glimmered at his side
was as still as a forest pool at midnight.</p>
<p>He fell to wondering about the canoe that
had stood so long by the water&rsquo;s brink. &ldquo;Who
can have been here? Who could have taken
it?&rdquo; he asked himself.</p>
<p>As he asked himself this question, his foot
struck some object that, in the silence of the
cave, gave off a dry and hollow sound. Leaping
back, he threw his flashlight upon the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A paddle,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;from the ancient
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange they didn&rsquo;t take that with them,&rdquo;
he thought after a moment spent in examining
it. &ldquo;Oh well, since they did not, I will. It is
elaborately carved and mounted with metal.
Looks like gold. A splendid keepsake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>Having picked up the paddle, he threw the
light of his torch about him in every direction.
Off to the right, further up from the beach,
some other object cast dark shadows on the
sand. An exclamation escaped his lips as he
came close to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A broken bit of a canoe!&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>Then like a flash it all came to him. &ldquo;No
one has been here,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;The
canoe has not been carried away. It was
wrecked by the great wave caused by the
earthquake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment he stood gazing upon the
bit of ancient wreckage. Then, suddenly
realizing that it was growing late, that it was
already dark outside the cave, he hurried on.</p>
<p>Darkness had indeed fallen when he reached
the outer world of the jungle. This did not
trouble him much. He had flashlights and a
lantern. There was a trail leading directly
to their camp. He would be there in two
hours.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;what am I to
do with this box of pearls? There are men
enough in this wild land who would split my
head open for much less than this. They
must not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he made his way through the underbrush,
now listening to the distant bark of a
crocodile and now catching the puh-puh-puh
of a jaguar, he pondered the problem of concealing
the treasure and of bringing it safely
to the outside world.</p>
<p>At last he hit upon what seemed a brilliant
idea. The box was the shape of a brick of
chicle, only smaller. When he got to camp
he would stuff the box with dried palm leaves
so it would not rattle, then he would wrap it
round and round with other palm leaves.</p>
<p>Having done this, he would remove one of
the two bricks of chicle in a gunnysack beneath
the storing shed and put in its place
the beaten silver box.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will mark that sack with a bit of green
thread woven in and out of the rough fibre.
It will be safe enough until I can decide what
to do with it. Does it belong to me, or to
the old Don? Guess I better talk it over with
my grandfather. He will know what is right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he arrived at camp he found everyone
asleep but one Carib watchman. As soon
as he made himself known to the watchman,
he inquired for his grandfather only to learn
that at present his grandfather was away, but
was expected back in the morning.</p>
<p>When, an hour later, he lay down to rest,
the beaten silver box with its priceless contents
lay in a coarse gunnysack beside a brick
of chicle worth fifty cents a pound. And about
it, above, below, on every side were other
sacks of chicle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must not let it get out of my sight,&rdquo; he
told himself. &ldquo;I must&mdash;&rdquo; At that he fell
asleep.</p>
<p>The journey of the day had been long, his
curious experience exhausting. He slept well;
too well. When he awoke, the sunlight sifting
down through the palm leaves shone upon his
face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>His first waking thought was of the beaten
silver box. Hurrying into his clothes, he fairly
raced to the storing shed. There his eyes
fell upon that which left him standing motionless,
speechless, struck dumb, paralyzed with
fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; he whispered feebly at last. &ldquo;The
whole pile of chicle at that end is gone, and
the silver box with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chicle is gone!&rdquo; he exclaimed to his
grandfather a moment later when that old
gentleman came into the shed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; his grandfather smiled. &ldquo;Monago
and his band of Caribs came in with me at
dawn from the north corner of the tract for
some supplies. I sent them with four pit-pan
loads of chicle down the river. They will
bring up supplies. The chicle will be shipped
at once. I received word yesterday that the
chicle supply was short and that ours should
be rushed through to meet the demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; the boy whispered as he crept
away for a few moments of quiet thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV
<br />HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL</h2>
<p>The end of the storm that had trapped
Johnny and Madge Kennedy in the heart of a
great banana plantation came suddenly.
Clouds went racing. The wind fell. The
moon shone again in all its golden glory. It
looked down upon a scene of unmatched
destruction.</p>
<p>Creeping from their place of refuge which
had all but become a pool, they allowed their
eyes to sweep the devastated fields.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the end; no doubt of it,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like the end of the world.&rdquo; There
was quiet humor in the girl&rsquo;s tone.</p>
<p>Strange and weird indeed was the scene that
confronted them. A palm, its tough stem
wrung and twisted by the storm, stood with
its fronds hanging down like a nun in prayer.
The broken trunks of massive dead trees
reared themselves toward the sky. Everywhere
the banana plants, which but a few
hours before had stood so proudly aloft, now
lay flat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred thousand bunches,&rdquo; the boy
murmured. &ldquo;And now all gone. What a
loss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All gone. I wonder,&rdquo; he murmured as he
lifted the topmost plant from off a heap of
its fellows. The bunch he cut away with his
machete was ready for shipment, and perfect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bruise,&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;Not a
banana missing. The plants beneath it formed
a pad to ease it down. There must be others,
hundreds, thousands, perhaps twenty
thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we have bananas!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
turning to Madge Kennedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they are not ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May as well be. We should be able to
buy them. The Fruit Company&rsquo;s boat will
not dock for ten days or two weeks. By that
time they will be worthless. Come on, let&rsquo;s
hurry back to the port.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Diaz won&rsquo;t let you take them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; he admitted in sudden despondency.
&ldquo;Of course he won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, I wonder if he&rsquo;d dare refuse?&rdquo;
he said to himself. &ldquo;He would not be serving
the best interests of his master if he did not
sell them to us at a salvage price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought of the wary Spaniard&rsquo;s visit to
Kennedy&rsquo;s home, and of his offer to buy the
grapefruit orchard; thought too of the prosperous-looking
American he had seen at the
foot of the Porte Zelaya dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if I will ever see that short, stout
American again?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;They say
he left yesterday morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer to this last question, though he
could not know it yet, was a decided yes. He
was to meet that mysterious American again
under very unusual circumstances. A strange
break of fate had predestined them to be
thrown together for many days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>As he followed the unerring guidance of the
Carib Indian through the maze of fallen trees
and destroyed banana plants back toward the
port, his thoughts were gloomy indeed. The
glory of the tropical moonlight seemed to
mock him. Every black mass of twisted banana
plants seemed a funeral pile on which his
dead hopes were to be burned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fate treats one strangely at times,&rdquo; he
told himself.</p>
<p>So it seemed. He had been endeavoring to
assist a very worthy, aged and needy man, one
who had given all his life to others. This
man had fought for his country, fearlessly at
the front of his command, yet he refused the
honor of being called &ldquo;Captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The World War was not the only one in
which he had fought. Time and again the
need of his humble fellow countrymen, the
black Caribs whose fathers and mothers had
been Indians and negro slaves, had called him
to his duty, and he had gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>On one occasion, during the terrible yellow-fever
plague, he had toiled days without end,
burying the Carib dead and caring for the
stricken ones until the hand of the dread
enemy was stayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a native in all Stann Creek district
but knows and loves him,&rdquo; Johnny told himself.
&ldquo;And now, in his old age, when he
truly needs a lift and we try to help him, see
how things come out! We are blocked by a
scheming Spaniard who never fought for any
country, nor for the good of any person beside
himself. He probably never had an unselfish
thought in the whole of his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thoughts were gloomy enough. But,
after climbing over many obstructions and
wading numerous small, swollen streams, he
began to reason with himself. What was this
&ldquo;Fate&rdquo; he was always thinking of? Was it
the great Creator, or was it some other being?</p>
<p>As he looked away at the golden moon, a
line of poetry came to him.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;God&rsquo;s in His Heaven,</p>
<p class="t0">All&rsquo;s right with the world.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder?&rdquo; he thought. Then, &ldquo;How
absurd! Of course it&rsquo;s true. Somehow there
must still be a way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His first visible justification of this faith
came to him the moment he stepped inside the
dock office. There, snugly sleeping on a
couch in the corner, was a slender, dark-skinned
child whose black eyelashes were long
and lovely. And there, pacing the floor before
her, was her father, the great plantation
owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don del Valle!&rdquo; the boy exclaimed. He
could scarcely believe his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Senor Johnny Thompson.&rdquo; The
man&rsquo;s tone seemed austere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I am truly sorry that your crop has
been ruined,&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I, sir, am disappointed in you, disappointed
that you should have taken advantage
of my endeavor to deal generously with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; the boy stammered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Excuses are unnecessary. You told me
you had a ship. Where is that ship? You said
you would take twenty thousand bunches.
Where are they? Are they on the ship? They
are there.&rdquo; He waved his hand toward the
devastated plantation.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s head whirled. What was this&mdash;more
treachery?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our boat,&rdquo; he said in as quiet a tone as
he could command, &ldquo;was at your dock three
days. In such a storm you could not expect
her to hold to her moorings. Where is she
now? Who knows? Perhaps at the bottom
of the sea. The reason she left without a
cargo was that your manager, Senor Diaz,
would not supply it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this true?&rdquo; The dark eyes of the
Honduran capitalist bored him through and
through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask any workman on the dock or in the
village. If he has not been corrupted by a
scoundrel, he will tell you it is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whirling about, the man shot a few sharp
questioning words in Spanish to a boy who
sat half asleep in the corner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>Starting up, the boy answered rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says,&rdquo; Don del Valle turned slowly
about, &ldquo;that all you have told me is the truth.
It is my honor to beg your most humble pardon.
You have been badly treated. Ask me
some favor and I will grant it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s heart beat fast. His mind worked
like some speeding mechanism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of one who deserves much,
our friend Donald Kennedy, I shall ask one
favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you sell me the crop of bananas on
this plantation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are worthless. The storm has
ruined them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not all. There is still a ship load of good
ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I grant such a request? I am
under contract to deliver these bananas to the
Fruit Company.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No contract,&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s voice vibrated
with earnestness, &ldquo;stands before an act of
God. The storm was an act of God. No
Fruit Company&rsquo;s ship will be here within ten
days. By that time it will be too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right. Your request is granted.
To-morrow I will send my men into the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By your leave,&rdquo; said Johnny quickly, &ldquo;I
will buy them as they are in the field. I will
gather and load them myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The owner gave him a piercing look, then
having recalled Johnny&rsquo;s past experience, he
said slowly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. This also is granted. You
may use my equipment. Ten cents a bunch in
the field, a salvage price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a slight move at the door. Together
they turned to look. There stood Diaz.
His white face showed that he had heard
much, understood all.</p>
<p>Don del Valle pointed a finger of accusation
and scorn at him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>He vanished into the dark. His plotting
was not at an end, however. He went directly
to a long shed where many men, beachcombers,
longshoremen, chicleros and banana gatherers,
were sleeping. There he began to sow
the seeds of a hasty revolution and a wild
demonstration against the hated white men,
which was destined once more to threaten disaster
to Johnny Thompson&rsquo;s plans.</p>
<p>Early that morning one might have found
Johnny alone at the edge of the banana plantation.
To one unaccustomed to Johnny&rsquo;s
ways, his actions might have seemed strange.
Was he taking his daily dozen? Perhaps, but
surely they were a queer dozen.</p>
<p>If you know Johnny at all you are aware of
the fact that he is a skillful boxer. But down
there in the tropics bare hands avail little.
Johnny was not shadow boxing. The thing
he was doing was quite different. He was
keeping fit all the same.</p>
<p>A stout young mahogany tree had sprung
up in the midst of the banana field. From a
tough limb of this tree Johnny had suspended
a large bunch of bananas. The top of the
bunch was a little higher than Johnny&rsquo;s shoulders,
the tip a foot from the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>Seizing one of two machetes, great long
bladed knives like swords, that lay on the
ground, the boy began circling the swinging
bunch of bananas as one might a mortal
enemy. Brandishing his machete, he circled
this imaginary enemy three times. Then, as if
an opening had appeared, he made a sudden
onslaught that sent green bananas thudding
to earth and set the bunch spinning wildly.</p>
<p>Then he parried and thrust as an imaginary
blade sang close to his head. Once more, with
a lightning-like swing, he sprang in. This
time he split a single banana from end to end
and sent the severed halves soaring high.</p>
<p>He sprang back. No true blade could have
inspired greater skill than the boy displayed
before an empty world and without a real adversary.</p>
<p>The battle ended when with one swift stroke
he severed the stem in the middle and with a
sweeping twirl sent it thudding down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cut his head off!&rdquo; he chuckled, throwing
himself upon the ground to mop the perspiration
from his brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like boxing,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;this great
Central American sport of machete fighting,
only&mdash;it&rsquo;s different. You feel as if only half
of you were in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a boxer Johnny was neither right nor
left handed. He was ambidextrous. Therein
lay much of his power. How few of us ever
learn to use both hands well. Yet what an
advantage comes to those who do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble with this machete business,&rdquo;
he now thought to himself. &ldquo;Only one
hand, that&rsquo;s all you use. And yet, why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprang to his feet, selected a second
bunch of bananas, hung it on high, then prepared
as before to attack it. This time, however,
he wielded a machete in each hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>At first he found it awkward. Once he
barely missed cutting his own wrist. By the
time he had demolished three other bunches he
felt that he was making progress and that an
ambidextrous fighter with two knives would
have a decided advantage over one who fought
with a single blade.</p>
<p>Johnny, as you may have guessed, was preparing
for that moment which he felt must
come sooner or later, when he and Diaz would
stand face to face ready to fight their battle
out with the great Central American blade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when that time comes,&rdquo; he told himself,
&ldquo;it must not find me unprepared.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV
<br />UNSEEN FOES</h2>
<p>It was night, such a night as only the tropics
knows. Night, dead calm, hot, and no moon.
Motionless clouds hanging low, and dark.
Such a darkness as Pant had never before
known hung over all.</p>
<p>Ten feet below him was the sea. He sensed
rather than saw it, felt the long rolling lift of
its swells as the Carib sailing boat gently rose
and fell.</p>
<p>They were a mile out to sea, becalmed.
There should be no one near them. There had
been no craft near when darkness fell. In
such a calm no boat could sail, and who would
care to row on such a hot, oppressive night?
Yet, strange as it may seem, from time to time
he imagined that some faint sound came drifting
in from the black void that engulfed them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;There was
no one near at sunset. There is no one now.
That silver box of pearls has gotten on my
nerves. I will go to sleep and forget it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not sleep at once. His mind was
filled with many things. His pursuit of the
pit-pan loads of chicle which his grandfather
had sent down the river had been a strenuous
one. A pit-pan, the seventy foot dugout of
the Carib country, when manned by a score of
expert boatmen, is a swift river craft. Without
giving his grandfather any definite reason
for his sudden departure, he had hired a twelve
foot dugout from a native bushman and had
set out in pursuit of the chicle sack that contained
his treasure of pearls in a beaten silver
box. For long hours, eating little, scarcely
sleeping at all, he had held on in pursuit. At
the end of the second day his frail craft had
shot boldly out into the ocean. There he met
the pit-pans on their return trip.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>For the moment he counted all lost. When
they told him that the chicle had been stowed
away aboard a Carib sailing vessel manned by
his grandfather&rsquo;s men and bound for Belize,
his spirits rose. An hour later found him
aboard that boat, munching dry casaba bread
and talking to the Caribs between bites.</p>
<p>He had not told them why he had come, but
gave them to understand that he was to sail
to Belize with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Belize,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;before the
chicle is brought aboard the steamer, I will
claim my precious bag. It will be time enough
to decide then what the next move shall be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now here we are becalmed,&rdquo; he
thought to himself with a low shudder.</p>
<p>Strange and terrible things had happened
in these waters. They had been the hunting
grounds of buccaneers. As he closed his eyes
he seemed to hear the creaking of windlasses,
the heavy breathing of men in the dark, the
boom of cannon, the rattle of muskets, the
ring thud of steel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Those days are gone,&rdquo; he told himself,
shaking himself free from the illusion. But
were they? Only the year before four black
men, who had engaged to carry two rich traders
across the bay, had murdered their passengers
and sailed to some unknown haven
with their spoils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always a little danger down here,&rdquo; he
thought. &ldquo;Revolutions and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose suddenly on an elbow, to listen intently.
Sure as he was a rational human
being, out of that darkness had come a sound.</p>
<p>With a hand that trembled slightly, he
touched a dark form close beside him. Something
there stirred; otherwise there was not
a sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; His whisper was low and tense.
&ldquo;Not a word! There is some one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? Where?&rdquo; came back still in a
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows, Tuan? You listen. Your
ears are better than mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tish!&rdquo; came the black-brown man&rsquo;s low
expression of appreciation, then all was silence
once more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>Tuan was one of those Caribs who, somewhere
back in the dim distance, had a black
slave for an ancestor. A great gaunt man,
he was endowed with the strength of the
black race and the endurance of the red man.
A lifetime in the bush had given him the ear
of a jaguar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tish!&rdquo; he whispered a moment later.
&ldquo;Truly there came a sound. But who can it
be? Our other schooner is near. They may
have put off a dory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence once more. A swell larger than
those that went before lifted the boat high,
tilted her to a rakish angle, then let her fall.
The boom rattled, the lazy sail flapped. After
that the silence was greater than before.</p>
<p>To Pant the situation was a trying one. He
found himself only a passenger on a boat
chartered by his grandfather. He had no
authority here. If he had, would he awaken
the crew? He hardly knew. One does not
suspect a single sound. In the tropics not all
who come near are rascals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>And yet, aboard that schooner, or its mate
lying close alongside, was the gunnysack with
the green thread running through it&mdash;a rude
container for a rich treasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I should lose it now!&rdquo; His breath
came short at the thought. He had risked his
life for a treasure which he somehow felt did
not belong to him, but which, nevertheless, he
was now morally bound to preserve.</p>
<p>Suddenly his thoughts broke short off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There!&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely.</p>
<p>But Tuan was on his feet. He was striking
out at something in the dark. His eyesight
was quite as remarkable as his hearing.</p>
<p>There came a loud splash. Tuan had not
gone overboard, but some one had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are being boarded,&rdquo; was the thought
that shot through the boy&rsquo;s mind as he struggled
to his feet.</p>
<p>But what was this? There came a second
splash, another, and yet another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The chicle!&rdquo; he exclaimed out loud, unthinking.
&ldquo;They are throwing it overboard!&rdquo;
The deck was piled high with gunnysacks
filled with chicle. Was the sack of the green
thread among them? He had come aboard
too late to know. Were these boarding ruffians
Diaz&rsquo;s men, or were they of another sort?
Had they somehow learned of the treasure?
Were they after that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could they know?&rdquo; he asked himself.</p>
<p>His head whirled. What was to be done?
He took a step forward and instantly collided
with some bulky object.</p>
<p>At once he found himself grappling with
the oily body of a native. Over and over they
rolled on the deck. They bumped first into a
heap of chicle, then into the gunwale. This
last appeared to stun his opponent. Seizing
the opportunity, he grasped him by an arm
and leg to send him overboard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>He caught the call of Tuan, heard the Caribs
swarming up from below, listened for a second
to blows that fell all about him; then,
finding himself within a circle of sudden light,
staggered backward to fall clumsily, and to at
last pitch backward into the sea.</p>
<p>He struck out in the direction he hoped was
right for the ship. The sea was warm as dish
water. Sharks and crocodiles lurked everywhere.
He must get aboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then what?&rdquo; he asked himself.</p>
<p>About him sounded cries, calls, blows, signs
of wild confusion. Then came the creak of
oarlocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dory! Our dory from the other boat.
Reinforcements!&rdquo; Hope arose.</p>
<p>His hand touched something hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bag of chicle,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Supposing
it was the bag of the green thread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thing was buoyant. Dragging himself
upon it, he took time to look about him. A
light flared here, then went out. A torch
flamed, shot upward, circled down, hissed in
the water and went out. The circle of a flashlight
revealed four men in deadly embrace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Got to get back. They need me.&rdquo; Having
found the direction of the boat, he swam
quickly to it. There, having made his way
cautiously about it, and coming into contact
with a dugout that most certainly was not
their own, he capsized and sunk it.</p>
<p>A little further on his hand gripped a rope.
A moment later he was aboard the schooner
again.</p>
<p>Suddenly a bright light streamed out. Some
one had lighted a gas lantern and hung it
high on the mast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will end it,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>It did, for him. An iron belaying pin,
hurled square at him, took him in the temple.
After that, for several hours, he knew no more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><br />CHAPTER XVI
<br />IN BATTLE ARRAY</h2>
<p>At dawn of the day after the hurricane, Don
del Valle and his beautiful black-eyed daughter
hastened away in his high powered motor boat.
That he might determine the amount of damage
done by the storm, it was necessary for
him to leave for his other plantation at once.
Johnny Thompson went to the wireless station
to begin a search in air for the <i>North Star</i>
and her courageous captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she has been wrecked, or if she has been
carried far by storm, and the skipper refuses
to return, we are lost,&rdquo; he said to Madge
Kennedy.</p>
<p>For an hour he sent out messages. Each
moment he became more depressed. What if
the ship had been lost?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One more evil happening to be charged
against my too impetuous desire to be of service,&rdquo;
he groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hope it has not happened,&rdquo; said
the girl. &ldquo;Captain Jorgensen has sailed these
seas for many years. He is hardly the man
to lose his vessel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good news!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed a moment
later when he was brought a message. &ldquo;The
<i>North Star</i> is anchored behind Mutineer&rsquo;s
Island, all safe and sound. I will get off a
message instructing them to pull away for
our own dock at once. There we will pick
up your crates of grapefruit and a hundred or
so of your Caribs. We will bring them here
to gather and load the bananas. They can
be trusted. I put no faith in the half-castes
that swarm about this dock. We have been
defeated by them once. Once is enough for
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I tell you!&rdquo; he exclaimed, seizing the
girl by the hand and doing a wild Indian dance
across the floor, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll win yet!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You forget,&rdquo; said the girl soberly, &ldquo;that
the great, all-powerful organization, the Fruit
Company, may block your sales after you arrive
in New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Johnny could not be disheartened. The
ship was his. The bananas were his also. He
had men to gather and load them. New York
and the day of their arrival were far away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,&rsquo;&rdquo;
he quoted, then hurried to get off a
message to Kennedy. With Kennedy on the
job, the grapefruit would be ready to load,
and the Caribs prepared to steam away with
them to the dock here at Porte Zelaya.</p>
<p>Johnny was soon enough to know that this
day&rsquo;s evil was indeed sufficient unto itself.
He had not left the wireless room before bad
news arrived. The giant Carib, who had come
in a motor boat to Porte Zelaya, and who had
been with Johnny and Madge in the storm,
had been loafing about the dock with his ears
open. Those ears had caught snatches of
terrible things. He told Madge of all this in
his native tongue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Johnny asked as he saw the
look of terror creep into her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A plot!&rdquo; She said the words through
white, set lips. &ldquo;That rascal Diaz, who was
discharged from his position as foreman, is
plotting to destroy your plans, and you with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How? How could he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is stirring up a revolution. He is telling
the ignorant half-castes that the white men
rule their country, that they have been paid
very little for much hard work, and that now
they are to be deprived of that work altogether,
that you are to bring a ship load of
Caribs from Stann Creek to do the work which
is rightfully their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That in part is true,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;I
wonder if, after all, I am wrong? Would they
do the work if I were to offer it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madge consulted the Carib. He shook his
head and waved his hands in wild gestures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He says they would not work,&rdquo; interpreted
the girl, &ldquo;that their blood is hot, that
they lust for battle and that they will meet
us at the dock with clubs and machetes&mdash;a
hundred, two hundred, perhaps three hundred
strong. They want a fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s tone was deep and
strong. &ldquo;They shall have a fight, if fight there
must be. We are within our rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped back to the wireless to send one
more message. The message which went to
Kennedy, ran;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have every able-bodied Carib at Stann
Creek at the dock, every man armed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later their motor boat was
popping, and the dock and low sheds of Porte
Zelaya were fading in the distance.</p>
<p>When Johnny and Madge, riding on the
prow of the motor boat with the giant Carib
at the wheel, rounded a point of land and
came in sight of the dock at Stann Creek, they
were given the thrill of their young lives.
The dock was one moving mass of men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Caribs!&rdquo; A lump came to the girl&rsquo;s
throat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They came,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew they would. They would do anything
for grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. The instant Johnny&rsquo;s word
from the air had arrived, messengers had been
sent helter-skelter, here, there, everywhere.
The train on the narrow gauge railroad had
gone into the bush to return groaning and
creaking with such a load of black and brown
humanity as had never before been seen on
the backwaters of Central America.</p>
<p>Every grown Carib within twenty miles of
the dock was there. The instant the <i>North
Star</i> came alongside they swarmed upon the
deck.</p>
<p>The loading of the grapefruit with the aid
of so many strong and willing hands was but
the work of a few hours. Then, with a load
of humanity greater than her load of fruit, the
ship cast off her moorings and headed straight
for the dock at Porte Zelaya where, Johnny
felt sure, there awaited them a great and terrible
battle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>As the boy walked the deck his eyes shone
with joy. Whoever commanded a stronger,
braver, more loyal army than the black throng
that, swarming up the hatches, perched themselves
on mast and rigging, forecastle, after
deck and anchor, until there was scarcely space
left to move?</p>
<p>As his eyes swept the deck they lighted with
a sudden new joy. They had fallen upon a
figure garbed in a dress of gorgeous golden
yellow. The one white girl of the company,
the queen of all the Stann Creek region, had
not deserted them. There, on a coil of rope
beside her patriarchal grandfather, sat Madge
Kennedy, smiling her very best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great! Great!&rdquo; Johnny murmured.
&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>His brow clouded. There was to be a fight.
The thing seemed inevitable. It would be a
bloody battle. He knew well enough what
these battles between Caribs and half-castes
meant. Once, on the far reaches of the Rio
Hondo, he had witnessed such a battle. It had
been a rather terrible affair. As he closed his
eyes now he heard the thwack of mahogany
clubs on unprotected heads, caught the swish
of great swinging knives, saw the agony of
hatred and fear on dark faces where blood ran
free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said then I hoped I&rsquo;d never see another
such battle,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;and yet here
we are driving straight on toward one that
promises to be quite as terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before him, sitting astride the rail, was a
Carib youth. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be over eighteen,&rdquo;
Johnny mused.</p>
<p>He had never in his life seen a more cheerful,
smiling face. To look at him, to catch
the glint of his eye, the gleam of his white
teeth, to see the rollicking movement of his
face, was like viewing a wonderful waterfall
against a glorious sunset.</p>
<p>Could it be that before this day was done
that glorious face might be still in death?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>For a moment Johnny felt like turning back.
What was success, even success in a righteous
cause, when it must be purchased at such a
cost?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he reasoned, &ldquo;we cannot turn
back. The right must be defended. It must
always be so. Perhaps there is a way to avert
it, but come what may, we must go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having arrived at this conclusion, he
walked quietly down the deck to take his place
beside Donald Kennedy and his granddaughter.</p>
<p>For some time they talked in low tones, the
man and the boy, and the girl listened. Little
wonder that they talked earnestly. Much was
at stake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might work,&rdquo; said Johnny at last.
&ldquo;Anyway, we&rsquo;ll try it. You can talk to them
in Spanish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the end of conversation. After
that they sat there looking and listening.
From somewhere forward there came the rattle
of a banjo, the tom-tom-tom of a snake-head
drum. Aft, the chant of a weird song
rose and fell with the boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t realize they are going to war,&rdquo;
said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the pity. They never do,&rdquo; said the
girl, shading her eyes to gaze away at the perfect
blue of the lovely Caribbean Sea.</p>
<p>All too soon the thrum of the banjo ceased,
the tom-tom of the drum became muffled and
low. Land, the point of Porte Zelaya, had
been sighted.</p>
<p>Rising, the girl and the old man made their
way along the deck. As they moved along
they spoke in low tones to the men and the
men, as if moved by some magic spell, rose
slowly to go shuffling forward or aft, and to
disappear down the hatchways, leaving the
decks almost deserted.</p>
<p>When the <i>North Star</i> came within hailing
distance of the dock, which was swarming with
half-castes drawn up in battle array, a little
group of some fifty black Caribs were gathered
on the forward deck of the <i>North Star</i>. That
was all. Not a pike pole nor machete was in
sight. They seemed only a small group of
laborers prepared for a day&rsquo;s work of gathering
and loading bananas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>A breathless expectancy hung over all the
ship as it came in close, reversed her engines,
dropped anchor and stood off the wharf for
further orders.</p>
<p>The great man of the jungle, Donald
Kennedy, tall, stately of bearing, yet humble,
stepped forward to the rail and began to speak
in quiet tones to the throng on the deck.</p>
<p>At once there arose a terrific shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down with the white man! Death to the
intruder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words were shouted in Spanish, but
Johnny knew their meaning well enough. He
thrilled and shuddered. Pike poles were tossed
in air above the dock, great knives flashed in
the sun, a pistol exploded. What was to be
the end of it all?</p>
<p>Again came comparative silence. Again the
aged man spoke. Patiently, as if speaking to
children, he began.</p>
<p>Again he was interrupted by cries of;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Death! Destruction! Down with the
white man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four times, with steady patience, the great
man attempted to make himself heard.</p>
<p>At last, realizing the futility of it all, he
turned and shouted three words in the Carib
tongue.</p>
<p>Instantly there came from the black men
forward a shout to answer that of the half-castes
on the dock. At the same time, pike-poles
and machetes flashed and four streams
of humanity, black and menacing, began pouring
up the hatchways.</p>
<p>Johnny Thompson thrilled and grew deathly
cold at sight of them. They swarmed up the
masts, they filled the deck, they straddled the
rail and crowded the roofs of the cabins.
Everywhere weapons gleamed. From every
corner rang the defiant shout of Caribs ready
to defend with their lives the rights of Kennedy,
whom they had come to think of as a
loyal friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>No pirate ship that sailed these waters in
days that are gone ever witnessed a more tremendous
and startling demonstration.</p>
<p>Before it, awed into silence, the mob on the
dock fell back, then began slipping away. One
by one they slunk off into the bush. In ten
minutes time not a man was left. A bloodless
victory had been won. The field was theirs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><br />CHAPTER XVII
<br />PANT&rsquo;S PROBLEM INCREASES</h2>
<p>When Pant awoke from many bad dreams,
he found himself in a cool and comfortable
bed on shore. A doctor was bending over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine, old boy,&rdquo; the doctor was saying.
&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ll do. You got quite a welt
on the head. But your jolly old bean is hard.
Never cracked it a mite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the treasure box!&rdquo; Pant exclaimed,
still unable to think clearly, or use caution.
&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The treasure box? I see you are still a
little off in the head. Here, take this; it will
clear you up,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>Pant took the contents of the glass held out
to him at a single draught and without a question.
In the meantime his head cleared. He
said no more about the box of pearls, but
learned by judicious questioning that the attacking
band had on the night before been
driven off with little loss of men or goods.
A few sacks of chicle had drifted away in the
night, that was all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if one of them has a green thread
running through the sack!&rdquo; he thought to
himself, and was thrown into a near panic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the schooners?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.
&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a fair wind and sailed this morning
for Belize. Must be there by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll load the chicle aboard the
Torentia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she sails&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In about twenty-four hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor!&rdquo; exclaimed the boy sitting
straight up in bed and gripping his arm hard.
&ldquo;Fix me up someway. I&rsquo;ve got to get over
to Belize. At once! Right away, doctor. This
very minute!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, young fellow,&rdquo; said the doctor,
rescuing his arm and putting on a wry face as
he rubbed it vigorously, &ldquo;you seem to have
plenty of strength. I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour later, a trifle unsteady on his
feet, but otherwise quite himself, Pant was
making his way to the water front of Stann
Creek, the port to which he was carried after
the battle. He felt the heavy bandages about
his head, blinked at the sunlight, looked this
way then that, until spying what appeared to
be a small store just before him, he hurried in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a boat,&rdquo; he said to the black proprietor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any boat that will take me to Belize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No boat go to-day.&rdquo; The man settled back
in his corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean they won&rsquo;t go to-day?&rdquo; The
boy&rsquo;s brow wrinkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for any price?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Special trip, go. Maybe. You got
twenty dollars?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>Pant hesitated. He had twenty dollars and
a little change. To part with it all would seem
to be courting disaster. But much was at
stake. He threw all in the balance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have twenty dollars. Where is the
boat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me see.&rdquo; The man held out a hand. Pant
showed him two golden eagles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boat sailing boat. Good boat. Very
fast boat. Ready to go, fifteen minutes.&rdquo; At
sight of the gold the man went into action.</p>
<p>Action on land is one thing. On sea it is
quite another. They were half way up the
bay when the wind fell. The sail fell with it,
and the boat stood still in a placid sea.</p>
<p>For two precious hours the boy with a
bruised and aching head lay beneath a pitiless
tropical sun. Then the merciful after dinner
breeze came up and at once they went booming
along.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>Nothing can be more delightful than a sail
in a Carib boat on the Caribbean Sea. To lie
on deck and sense the lifting glide of the prow,
to feel the cool breeze on your face, to see
the water go rippling by, that is joy indeed.
Pant would have enjoyed it to the full had
not his mind been vexed by many questions.
Would he reach Belize in time or would the
steamer be gone? Was the chicle sack of the
green thread still on the sailing boat of the
night before, or had the marauders carried it
away? If it were still on board, if it went to
America and he did not go with it, what then?
Would he recover the treasure?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;I must
have been out of my head to hide the box in
such a place. But now I must see it through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why must I?&rdquo; he asked himself, and at
once came the answer, &ldquo;The old Don.&rdquo; Unconsciously
he had come to think of the treasure
of pearls as belonging as much to the aged
Don as to himself. And to that man he owed
much. He had, beyond doubt, once saved his
grandfather&rsquo;s life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>They were nearing Belize. The white
houses with their red roofs showed in the distance.
And, joy of joys! There to the left was
the <i>Torentia</i> riding at anchor.</p>
<p>Still there was much to fear. She might at
any moment weigh anchor and put out to sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after all,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;what
am I to do? By this time the chicle is stowed
away. Dare I make a clean breast of my
story? I wouldn&rsquo;t dare trust them. What
then? I must go with the ship to New York.
But I have no money. Who is to pay my passage?&rdquo;
Surely here was a situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will find a way. I must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in the end he did. Sailing time was
only a half hour off when he climbed the rope
ladder to the deck of the <i>Torentia</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, brother,&rdquo; said the purser, looking at
his bandaged head. &ldquo;What revolution did you
come from? Did they make you President or
only commander of the navy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither,&rdquo; said Pant with a grin that went
far. &ldquo;I want to go to New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got any money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That last shipment of chicle you took on
board belonged to my grandfather. I&rsquo;ll wire
him for money in New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots of broke Americans down
here. They&rsquo;ve all got rich relatives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prove it.&rdquo; Sitting down upon the
hatch, Pant told things about Colonel Longstreet
that went far to prove that he at least
was a boon companion of the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re square,&rdquo; said the purser at
last. &ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;ll take a chance. Steward
will fix you up later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By careful inquiry Pant learned that the
chicle had been stored beneath the forward
hatch. The hatch was kept open. There were
twenty thousand bunches of bananas on board.
They must have air. By leaning far over the
hatch he could see ends of the chicle bags.
Was the one he wanted there?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be sure,&rdquo; he warned himself. &ldquo;Too
dark down there. Have to get closer,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Will, too, after a while. See if I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><br />CHAPTER XVIII
<br />TWO BLADE JOHNNY</h2>
<p>On the dock at Porte Zelaya, the task of
loading bananas was at last progressing. At
regular intervals all that long forenoon and
well into the day, the little engine with its
string of cars came puffing and rattling down
the narrow gauge track. With its cars groaning
under the great loads of green which it
brought, it came to a halt on the dock. There,
in exact imitation of the ants that had entertained
Johnny on the previous day, the barefooted,
perspiring Caribs seized upon the precious
fruit, to pass it from hand to hand and
store it carefully away in the hold of the ship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>Johnny, with an eye out for trouble, was
everywhere. Now on the dock, now on the
train and now in the heart of the banana plantation,
his keen eye took in everything. Yet
no trouble came. A few disconsolate Spanish
banana workers hung about. Such of these
as seemed willing to render honest service
Johnny set to work.</p>
<p>Dressed in the simplest of garb, cotton shirt,
khaki trousers and high-topped boots, Johnny
nevertheless drew forth many a covert smile
from the black Caribs, for he wore at his belt
not one machete, but two&mdash;one on either side,
and none of the Caribs had ever before seen
a man carry two such weapons.</p>
<p>The sun was hanging low over the storm
wrecked banana plantation, their task was well
nigh completed when Johnny, seeing some
straggling young banana plants growing in a
half cleared patch to the right of the track and
believing that here he might find a few superb
bunches, hurried away down a narrow deer
trail.</p>
<p>He had reached the nearest bunch of bananas
and was about to cut it down when
something sprang at him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>His first thought, as his heart went racing
and he dropped to earth with the quickness of
a cat, was that he had come close to the lair
of a jaguar.</p>
<p>This thought was dispelled by the white
gleam of a blade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diaz!&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;And we are
alone. There is to be a battle after all, a battle,
perhaps to the death, with weapons which
he has been familiar with since a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One thought gave him courage as, springing
away to the right, fighting for time to draw a
blade, hotly pursued by the panting Spaniard,
he rounded a great mahogany tree.</p>
<p>Having drawn his right hand blade, he took
a stand in a raised spot offering some slight
advantage.</p>
<p>His crafty opponent did not rush him. Instead
he attempted to outmaneuver him by
springing first to right, then to left, to at last
completely circle him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not win by that,&rdquo; thought Johnny
as the blood still pounded at his temples.
&ldquo;That is like boxing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>This maneuvering gave him time for a few
darting thoughts as to how the affair was to
end. If he were killed, what then? He hoped
his body might be found at once. Madge
Kennedy would never consent to the ship&rsquo;s
starting without him, dead or alive. That he
knew well enough. He wanted this, his last
undertaking, to succeed, wanted it desperately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow I must outmaneuver him,&rdquo; he
thought. At once his mind turned to that
extra blade.</p>
<p>There was no time for drawing it, for of a
sudden his opponent, with blade lifted high,
sprang squarely at him. Had Johnny been beneath
that blade when it fell, his skull must
have been split. With skill acquired as a
boxer, he leaped away and the machete, slipping
from the Spaniard&rsquo;s unnerved hand,
dropped harmless on the moss.</p>
<p>There was no time for Johnny to seize his
opponent&rsquo;s blade. There was opportunity to
draw his left hand blade. Draw it he did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>The expression on the Spaniard&rsquo;s dark and
angry face as he found himself facing two
blades was strange to see. Plainly he was puzzled
and nonplussed. He had fought and beyond
doubt done for more than one man who,
like himself, wielded a single machete. But
what of this boy who seemed at home with
two?</p>
<p>He wasted little time in thought, but springing
with a twisting glide, he attempted to
throw Johnny off his guard. In this he was
not successful.</p>
<p>For a full quarter of an hour, battling, perspiring,
crossing blades, bending, thrusting,
each striving for an advantageous opening, the
two men fought on.</p>
<p>Then a sudden catastrophe threatened. On
stepping backward Johnny caught his heel in
a tie-tie vine that grew low to the ground.
The next instant, with the Spaniard all but
on top of him, he went crashing to earth.</p>
<p>With a look that was terrible to see, the
Spaniard aimed what he meant to be a final
blow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>A hush hung over the jungle. The blade
came swinging down. But not too fast. As
if dodging a boxer&rsquo;s blow, Johnny shot his
head to one side. Burying itself a half blade&rsquo;s
length in the ooze, the knife struck there. Nor
did it come away when the frantic Spaniard
pulled at it. It had become firmly embedded
in the buried stump of a mahogany tree.</p>
<p>The next instant the Spaniard felt himself
lifted bodily in air. Then with senses reeling
he came crashing down.</p>
<p>When he came to himself he found himself
bound hand and foot. After crashing him
to earth, Johnny had made use of the tie-tie
vine which had come near bringing him to his
end. With it he had bound his opponent hand
and foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You villain! You dirty dog!&rdquo; Johnny
hissed in his ear. &ldquo;I should kill you. You
have no right to live, you who strike when a
man is down. But I will spare you. The ants
may crawl over you for a few hours. After
that I will send some one.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>Gathering up three blades, souvenirs of the
expedition, he disappeared into the brush.</p>
<p>Ten hours later, laden to capacity with the
golden harvest of the tropics, the <i>North Star</i>
pointed her prow toward the north, while the
Caribs, now crowded into pit-pans and sailboats,
headed for home, lifting their voices in
song-like chants.</p>
<p>Only one little thing occurred to interrupt
the <i>North Star&rsquo;s</i> passage out of the Caribbean
Sea into the open ocean. The evening was
calm. They chanced upon a sailing boat lying
becalmed and helpless in the midst of the sea.
On the deck of the boat was a prosperous
looking man. Short and stout, and with a
very red face, he looked the part of a very busy
man who thought well of his importance in
the world of affairs, and who had by some
chance been caught in an eddy from which he
could not well extricate himself.</p>
<p>He requested that they take him aboard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>Johnny told him that he was not sure that
coming aboard the steamer would serve his
purpose. The man insisted; in fact he appeared
to act as though he owned the <i>North
Star</i>. So aboard he came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What boat is this?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>North Star</i>,&rdquo; said Johnny quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did we charter her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did who charter her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Fruit Company, of course.&rdquo; The
man&rsquo;s tone was overbearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s tone was still
quiet. &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man sniffed the air. &ldquo;Bananas!&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I am President of the Fruit Company,
and in that capacity I demand to know what
is the business of this steamer in these
waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s heart suddenly sprang up into his
throat. He tried to speak and could not. His
head whirled. The President of the great corporation
here on board his ship! The very
man who had the power to make or break
not alone him, but Kennedy and Madge as
well. The thing seemed impossible!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;F&mdash;fruit,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;She carries
fruit. Bananas, and for&mdash;forbidden fruit and&mdash;and
things like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew he was talking like an idiot, but
for the life of him he could not talk sense.
Little wonder. He was having his first little
chat with a millionaire, but it was not to be
his last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><br />CHAPTER XIX
<br />THE UNWILLING GUEST</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; said the magnate
who had been taken on board the <i>North Star</i>,
&ldquo;that this ship is loaded with bananas from
Central America, and that it is not chartered
by our Company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bananas and grapefruit.&rdquo; Johnny was
gaining control of himself. What if this were
a millionaire? What if it was in his power to
make or break them? He couldn&rsquo;t very well
do that before they arrived in New York, and
that metropolis was a long way off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, sir,&rdquo; said the capitalist, &ldquo;you have
been trespassing. This is forbidden cargo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who forbids it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without answering the man stared at him
for a moment. His next remark was guarded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t get a cargo anywhere along
the coast without bribing some one or taking
the cargo by force.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hot words leaped to Johnny&rsquo;s lips. He was
no thief. He had bribed no one. He left them
unsaid.</p>
<p>Instead, he watched the sailing boat, from
which the man had been taken, fade in the
distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let it stand at that,&rdquo; he said quietly.
&ldquo;In the meantime, where were you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going from Bacaray to Belize in that
worthless sailboat manned by spotted Caribs.
My motor boat was wrecked in the storm.
The sail boat was becalmed, and there we
were. Lay there for ten hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belize?&rdquo; Johnny wrinkled his brow. He
did not wish to touch at this capitol of British
Honduras. The Fruit Company was strong
there. Who could tell but that fruit inspectors
or health inspectors, in sympathy with the
Fruit Company, perhaps bribed by them,
would hold his ship off those shores until his
bananas were overripe and ruined.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Having him on board makes it worse,&rdquo; he
told himself. Again his brow wrinkled.</p>
<p>A happy thought struck him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are planning to stay in Belize for
some time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going back to New York on our boat the
<i>Arion</i>. She was to touch at Belize. Took on
her load at Puerte Baras.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny heaved a sigh of relief. &ldquo;The <i>Arion</i>
sailed six hours ago. It gives me great pleasure
to offer you my stateroom and a passage
to New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s smile irritated the man. His face
turned red. He seemed about to choke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;ll touch at Belize!&rdquo; he stormed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belize,&rdquo; said Johnny calmly, &ldquo;is four hours
off our course. We are headed for the open
sea, and eventually for New York. I don&rsquo;t
like to seem pig-headed, nor over important,
but we are not going to alter our course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this he was wrong. He was destined to
alter his course in a manner that was pleasing
to no one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You will take me to Belize or I will have
you up in the Marine Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not have much of a case,&rdquo; said
Johnny. &ldquo;You were adrift. We picked you
up at your own request. The law allows us
to charge you for your passage to our own
port. We&rsquo;ll pass that up. You may as well
make yourself comfortable. We will dock at
New York in good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very cold day when you dock in New
York with this&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man checked his speech with difficulty,
then turning on his heel, went stamping down
the deck.</p>
<p>He had said enough. Johnny guessed that
he had a scorpion on board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the time comes he&rsquo;ll bite,&rdquo; he told
himself.</p>
<p>For a moment he considered turning about
and heading for Belize. This thought was dismissed
in a moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; he told himself shortly.
&ldquo;That would double his chances of defeating
us. If he didn&rsquo;t tie us up in Belize, he&rsquo;d wire
New York and his entire pack would be upon
us. As it is he can&rsquo;t get off a word before he
reaches New York. That gives us a fighting
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if Providence was kind in sending
him to us,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>He turned and hurried forward to prepare
his stateroom for the Unwilling Guest, and
there was a smile on his face.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>&ldquo;It really isn&rsquo;t necessary to tell all you
know.&rdquo; Kennedy said this in a friendly drawl,
as he sat beside Johnny on the forward deck.
Madge Kennedy was there too. Johnny had
persuaded the old man to come along with
him on the <i>North Star</i>. &ldquo;The passage,&rdquo; he
had argued, &ldquo;will cost you nothing. Captain
Jorgensen is coming back for that cargo of
cocoanuts and chicle. He&rsquo;ll be glad to bring
you down. You may be able to help me a lot
in disposing of the fruit. Anyway, the trip
will do you good.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>So here they were, three good pals, an old
man, a young man and a girl.</p>
<p>Johnny did not reply to Kennedy&rsquo;s remark
about not telling all you know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told a man once the location of a mahogany
tract I meant to buy,&rdquo; Kennedy went on.
&ldquo;It was good mahogany, some of it six feet
through, five thousand feet to the tree. I told
that man and he went before me and bought it.
I talked too much then. I&rsquo;ve learned better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Unwilling Guest of yours,&rdquo; he
drawled after a time, &ldquo;that President of the
Fruit Company, has been on board twenty-four
hours and has never showed his head out
of his stateroom. Even pays the steward to
bring his meals to him. That right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice, friendly sort of a millionaire. That
right? Perhaps he thinks we&rsquo;re not worth
talking to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; the old man laid a hand gently
on the boy&rsquo;s knee, &ldquo;any man is worth talking
to&mdash;the poorest and most degraded has something
to say. If he can&rsquo;t tell you how to live,
he can tell you how <i>not</i> to live, and that&rsquo;s
sometimes most important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaning forward, he shaded his eyes to scan
the horizon.</p>
<p>Johnny did not so much as wonder what he
saw there. The sea was perfectly calm. Bits
of seaweed floated here and there. A seagull
skimmed low to drop like a single feather upon
the water, then to rise and float away in the
air.</p>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s eyes lingered first upon the sea,
then upon the girl, Madge Kennedy, who sat
close beside him. He thought he had never
known a finer girl. Brave and strong, good
color, clear eyes, a clearer skin, strong as a
man, yet tender hearted and kind, giving her
spare hours to her grandfather, yet alert and
alive to every sport and joy of life, she seemed
worthy of a place in a great drama or a book.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That friend of ours,&rdquo; said Kennedy, resuming
his seat, &ldquo;he will come out of his hole
sooner or later. Then he&rsquo;s going to talk. Who
will he talk to? To an old man. That&rsquo;s me.
Everyone talks to an old man if he has a
chance. Did you ever notice that, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fact, nevertheless. You watch. Natural
enough, I guess. When a man gets old, he
loses the burning desire he might have had to
become rich or famous. He gets to feeling
that he&rsquo;s about done his bit, and that it would
be nice and pleasant to sit beside the road and
give the younger ones a little advice. Don&rsquo;t
you ever forget that, Johnny. When an old
man talks, you listen. It&rsquo;s just as I said, if
he can&rsquo;t tell you how to live, he can tell you
how not to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he paused to stare at the sky. Wetting
a finger, he held it up to the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wind&rsquo;s changed,&rdquo; he muttered to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When he comes out,&rdquo; he went on as if
he had been talking all the time, &ldquo;when this
exclusive sort of millionaire President of the
Fruit Company talks, I&rsquo;m not going to tell
him I&rsquo;m part owner of this cargo. And you
needn&rsquo;t either. That way he&rsquo;ll think me a
harmless old man with a fair young granddaughter,
and he may tell me things we need
to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny!&rdquo; he exclaimed, springing suddenly
to his feet. &ldquo;I think we better run
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ru&mdash;run for it,&rdquo; Johnny stammered in
astonishment. &ldquo;Run from what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What storm? The sea&rsquo;s calm, smooth as
a floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see? Can&rsquo;t you smell it?&rdquo; The
old man sniffed the air. &ldquo;But then, of course,
you wouldn&rsquo;t. Me, I&rsquo;ve lived here on this sea
always. I know things in advance. We&rsquo;re
going to have a storm, a regular humdinger,
a mahogany splitter, and if we don&rsquo;t run, if
we can&rsquo;t convince the captain we ought to run,
I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s to come of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said Madge, springing up.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a steamer. See the smoke. You
can make her out too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>Kennedy unslung his binoculars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said after a moment of close
scrutiny, &ldquo;is the <i>Arion</i>. She&rsquo;s the Company&rsquo;s
steamer that our Unwilling Guest was to sail
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be all excited if he sees her,&rdquo; said
Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little good it will do him,&rdquo; grumbled
Kennedy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be far enough from the
<i>Arion</i> by night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hurried away to impart his all but miraculous
knowledge of the coming storm to the
captain.</p>
<p>The sea was still calm, though here and
there, racing away with the speed of the wind,
like hurried messengers, dark ripples sped
across its surface. It was then that the Unwilling
Guest left his stateroom for the first
time.</p>
<p>Perhaps he was so well accustomed to sea
travel that he could guess that their course
had been altered. However that may be, he
went at once to the bridge. There, after studying
the instruments for a moment, he turned
an angry face toward the stocky skipper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of course is this for New York,&rdquo;
he stormed. &ldquo;You are not headed for New
York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; said the skipper, unperturbed.
&ldquo;Storm&rsquo;s coming. We were due for the center
of it. We&rsquo;re running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Running! And not a ripple!&rdquo; The magnate&rsquo;s
voice was full of scorn.</p>
<p>As for the sturdy captain, he knew the sea.
The scorn of the millionaire meant nothing to
him. Quite unperturbed, he paced the deck
and watched the roll of the storm clouds that
mounted higher and higher along the horizon.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the companionway the
capitalist found Kennedy sitting placidly looking
away at the sea. Like Captain Jorgensen,
he had lived long. One storm more or less
did not matter.</p>
<p>True to Kennedy&rsquo;s prophesy, the rich man
sat down beside him and began to talk. Who
can face a storm without a companion?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Going to storm, the captain tells me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; rumbled Kennedy. &ldquo;Be a mighty
tough one over there.&rdquo; He poked a thumb toward
the west. &ldquo;Over there where the <i>Arion</i>
is travelling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other man started. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s our ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t change her course. Kept
straight on. Good ship, though. May weather
it all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say,&rdquo; the rich man
squirmed uneasily in his chair, &ldquo;that it will
be as bad as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be&mdash;over there.&rdquo; Again Kennedy&rsquo;s
thumb jerked.</p>
<p>The topic of a man&rsquo;s conversation is very
frequently determined by his surroundings and
by the events that are transpiring about him.
Was it thought of the storm and what it might
mean to him that directed this rich man&rsquo;s conversation,
or was it a casual remark thrown
out by the strange old man who sat beside
him?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See those two bits of seaweed out yonder,
tossing on the waves?&rdquo; Kennedy drawled.
&ldquo;Well, supposing one was you and the other
me, and there wasn&rsquo;t any ship. Supposing I
had houses and banks and bonds and you were
a plain ordinary seaman with nothing but a
chest full of old clothes. Do you suppose I&rsquo;d
have any better chance with the sea than you?
Sort of strange, isn&rsquo;t it, when you think about
it? Makes you feel unimportant and, and
futile, you might say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a long time the man who owned buildings
and banks, bonds and many ships upon
the sea did not answer. When he did speak
the thoughts he gave utterance to might not
seem to have been an answer, and then again
they might have.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our times,&rdquo; he said in a tone he had not
used before, low, well modulated, modest and
slow, &ldquo;are very strange. Men, many men,
most men perhaps, have come to think of
capital as a great monster that always crushes
the weak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But is that true? Take this Central America.
It is true that we, the Fruit Company,
have a monopoly of the banana importing
business. But what was Central America before
we came? Where miles on miles of bananas
grow there was wilderness. Where
naked half-savage people hunted deer and wild
pigs, or sucked the milk from cocoanuts, there
now lives a happy, reasonably prosperous and
contented people. Who changed it all? Did
not the Fruit Company do it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said after a moment, &ldquo;that
our young friend, this Johnny Thompson who
has somehow stolen a march on us and gotten
hold of a cargo of fruit, thinks he&rsquo;s a young
hero, a benefactor to mankind. I wonder if
he is right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; rumbled Kennedy.</p>
<p>Time had been when Kennedy would have
engaged this rich man of the world in sharp
debate. He was old now. He had learned
the futility of debate. Besides, he was greatly
interested in the approaching storm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>At midnight Johnny Thompson found himself
wrapped in a blanket and lying upon a
plank, endeavoring in vain to snatch a few
winks of sleep.</p>
<p>He found himself now standing almost upright
on his feet and now tilted in the other
direction until his very pockets seemed about
to turn wrongside out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some storm!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>Canvas boomed above him. The seamen
had stretched a canvas over the hatch to keep
out the spray. He was lying on that part of
the hatch that had not been uncovered. Having
given up his stateroom to the Unwilling
Guest, he had been obliged to take a bunk
below. During such a storm as they were now
weathering, the air below was not to be
endured.</p>
<p>Unable to sleep, he allowed his mind to
wander. Had they indeed missed the heart
of the storm, or were they in it now? How
was the storm to end? He thought of the
black rolling waves, and shuddered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we weather the storm safely, what then?
Will we come to dock safely in New York?
Will we be able to sell our cargo? Or will we
once more face defeat? And what of the
<i>Arion</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scrambling to his feet, he plunged off the
hatch, rolled to the deck, got caught in a
dash of foam, struggled to his feet, caught
the spray in his face, outrode a wave that
threatened to carry him overboard, then made
a dash for the wireless room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had&mdash;had any message from the <i>Arion</i>?&rdquo;
He struggled to gain his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About ten minutes ago,&rdquo; said the young
wireless operator. &ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Arion laboring hard</i>,&rdquo; Johnny read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All but&mdash;Wait. Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thrust a head set over the boy&rsquo;s ears.
Then his face went white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Arion</i> leaking amidship. Settling by the
bow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>For ten minutes, with the ship leaping up
and down beneath them, with the thud of
waves shaking her from stem to stern, they
waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone; the <i>Arion&rsquo;s</i> gone down!&rdquo; said
the young wireless man at last, mopping his
brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; He started as if struck by a ball.
&ldquo;That pick up we made, that rich man was
going on that boat, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment there was silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;that
the Captain must be notified. We couldn&rsquo;t
have helped them; too far away. Have to
tell him. But our Unwilling Guest, no use
telling him, not just yet. No use to disturb
folks needlessly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the young wireless man, &ldquo;no
use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then for a time they sat catching the crash
of the storm and wondering what ship would
be next.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><br />CHAPTER XX
<br />HAIL AND FAREWELL</h2>
<p>Fifteen minutes more of an ominous silence
which told plainer than words that the steamship
<i>Arion</i> with all on board had gone to her
final resting place at the bottom of the sea.
The very thought of it made Johnny feel sick
and faint. The shrill scream of wind in the
rigging became to him the cries of those who
called in vain for aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we reach them?&rdquo; he asked the
wireless man. &ldquo;There might be some we
could save.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance.&rdquo; The wireless man shook
his head gravely. &ldquo;Two or three hundred
miles away. If we tried it we&rsquo;d more than
likely go to the bottom. Besides, there are
two other ships closer than ours. I caught
their answer to the S. O. S. They can&rsquo;t do
anything either. The <i>Arion&rsquo;s</i> gone. God rest
their souls!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Give me your report,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
take it to the Captain. Got to get out of
here.&rdquo; He was shaking like a leaf. As he
shut his eyes he could see forms battling with
the black waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking the paper, Johnny threw the door
open and shot from the cabin.</p>
<p>The cool damp air revived his spirits. The
battle he fought in making the bridge over the
slippery water-washed deck put the old fighting
spirit into him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it,&rdquo; he told himself stoutly.
&ldquo;This ship won&rsquo;t go down. She&rsquo;s Norwegian
built. Done by the sons of ancient
Norsemen. Her every plank and beam is selected&mdash;flawless
and strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grizzled skipper received his message
without comment. On such a night one
expects anything.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>Battling his way back to the main deck,
Johnny crept forward to the main cabin.
There, he remembered, was a long mess table,
a cushioned seat or two along the wall, and
some chairs screwed down to the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might get a bit of rest,&rdquo; he told himself,
yawning.</p>
<p>As he threw the door open a great gust of
wind caught him and sent him in with such
force that he went sprawling on the floor.</p>
<p>Grumbling to himself, he struggled to his
feet. What was his surprise then to find himself
looking into the eyes of Madge Kennedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t stand my stateroom all alone
on such a night,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;I hoped
some one would be down here, so I came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you did,&rdquo; Johnny struggled to
a place opposite her, then looked across the
table at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not used to storms at sea,&rdquo; he said,
noting the weary expression on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not this kind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nor anyone else I guess. Don&rsquo;t worry.
We&rsquo;ll weather it. We&rsquo;ll be in New York one
of these days with our cargo. Then the sun
will be shining on both sides of the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it, Johnny?&rdquo; A wistful look came
into her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Johnny,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been thinking to-night of our orchard and
our jungle. I dreamed a bad dream last night.
Dreamed that we couldn&rsquo;t sell the fruit,
couldn&rsquo;t go back to our orchard and our jungle
because there was no money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be pretty bad, particularly for
Grandfather. He&rsquo;s lived there since he was
a very young man. He loves it and he loves
his black Caribs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Johnny,&rdquo; her eyes became suddenly
dreamy, her voice mellow, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read
in books how people who live in other lands
love their homes, their stone castles and their
thatched cottages, their apple orchards, their
groves and their tiny clustered villages. All
that sounds fine, but very far away. For we
too came to love our homes in the tropical
jungle. To see sunset redden behind the tops
of the tangled jungle, to hear the night birds
call, to see the shadow of palms lengthen and
lengthen, then to feel the damp of evening kiss
your cheeks. Oh yes, Johnny, there is a charm
in our land. And to us it is home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go home,&rdquo; said Johnny with suddenly
renewed determination, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll go
with that ancient alligator-skin traveling bag
of your grandfather&rsquo;s bursting with bales of
money. Never fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reassured by his words, the girl bent her
head forward on the table and fell asleep.</p>
<p>As for Johnny, he did not sleep. He waited,
watched and dreamed.</p>
<p>The motion of the ship was something tremendous.
Now she rose high in air to strike
square into a great world of water; and now,
lifting, lifting, lifting, she appeared to start
on a flying trip to the stars, only at last to
put her prow down as gently as a child drops
his foot on a pebbly shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a grand old ship,&rdquo; he thought to
himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>These were not his only thoughts. He
thought of the great, gray-whiskered man and
his granddaughter sitting there before him,
the man who had given much to humanity and
asked little in return.</p>
<p>Then he thought of the other one, their
Unwilling Guest. &ldquo;Providence,&rdquo; he whispered
suddenly. &ldquo;Providence took a hand. If we
had not picked him up; if he had sailed on the
<i>Arion</i> he would now be at the bottom of the
sea. Wonder what he will think of that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Providence,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;and back of
Providence, God. God must have some work
for that man to do, some great good work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morning broke at last and with it the storm
passed. The wind went down. The sun came
out. The sea was a thousand mountain ranges
rolled into one, and all tossing about, rising
and falling, like a new-born world.</p>
<p>The sea calmed. Hazy clouds drifted along
the horizon. The <i>North Star</i>, somewhat battered
by the storm, but still a very seaworthy
vessel, held steadily on her course.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>The Unwilling Guest came on deck. He
seemed weak and somewhat thoughtful. No
one had whispered a word to him of the ship
that had gone to her grave, but the very force
of the storm, the thundering peril of it had
been enough to make any man thoughtful.
Still he asked no questions, ventured no
remarks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><br />CHAPTER XXI
<br />ON THE TRAIL OF THE PEARLS</h2>
<p>The Captain of the <i>Torentia</i>, the ship on
which Pant had secured passage in so strange
a manner, was a wary old seadog. On first
indication of storm he had put in behind one
of those small islands that dot the seaboard,
and had there lain in safety until the storm
had passed. This does not mean, however,
that there were no interesting occurrences on
board that ship to be recorded. As yet Pant
had no certain knowledge regarding that
thread marked gunnysack and its rich contents
of pearls. Until he had made a try for
that he could not rest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<p>To get a look at the chicle stored there in
the forward hold was not so simple a task
as Pant had at first supposed it to be. To
begin with, it was a long way down to it from
the deck where the few passengers were allowed
to promenade. No companionway or
ladder led to it. When it was necessary to
take the temperature of the space where the
bananas were stored the simple expedient of
lowering a thermometer by a string was
resorted to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to go down there some way, I suppose,&rdquo;
he told himself. &ldquo;Hand over hand
perhaps. Trouble is, I have no rope, and besides
there is always some one hanging about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a strange situation. He wanted very
much to go down there and inspect the chicle,
yet he had no legal right to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not as if I meant to do anything that&rsquo;s
wrong,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;If I told them
what I wanted, there&rsquo;s not a man on board but
would help me, help me a lot too much. That&rsquo;s
the trouble. I dare not trust them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the second day out, he discovered a loose
rope coiled up close by the hatch. But all that
day seamen were working or lolling about
close to the hatch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Try it at night,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Use a
flashlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did &ldquo;try it at night.&rdquo; He met with
little success. Scarcely had he lowered himself
to the bottom and thrown on his electric
torch, than the night watch threw a more
powerful light upon him, then shouted down:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you doin&rsquo;? Come up out of there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was but one thing to be done&mdash;to
come.</p>
<p>The boy found his knees shaking as he
climbed the rope. He had a wholesome fear
of ship&rsquo;s discipline. On the high seas a captain
is a king. What would be done with him
now?</p>
<p>To his great surprise, nothing was done.
The night watch took the affair as a boyish
prank, and after a short lecture, let him go.
That, however, ended his attempts to examine
the chicle at sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have to wait until the stuff is in the warehouse,&rdquo;
he told himself. &ldquo;It will take some
quick moves after that. I&rsquo;ll have to see some
one high up in the Central Chicle office and
get permission to make the search. Shouldn&rsquo;t
wonder if I&rsquo;ll have to tell some one the whole
story. Might be safe enough. Suppose it
would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After these settled conclusions he gave himself
over to enjoyment of wonders of the ship
and the changing mysteries of the sea.</p>
<p>So, freed from the grip of the storm, the
two steamers smoked away toward a common
port, New York. On board each was a somewhat
worried boy, worried but eager; worried
about the outcome of their adventure, eager
for its end. The <i>Torentia</i>, being a faster boat,
docked first.</p>
<p>Fortune was with Pant for once. Scarcely
had the ship docked when he went springing
down the gangplank. The doctor had looked
at his tongue, the immigration official glanced
over his papers, then set him free.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>To find the offices of the Central Chicle
Company he discovered was something of a
task. Once there he found himself confronted
by a long room full of clicking typewriters and
a smiling but determined girl at the telephone
switchboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Daniels,&rdquo; he was informed, &ldquo;is in conference.
Will you wait? Have you an
appointment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He, of course, had none.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Fraid you won&rsquo;t be able to see him to-day.&rdquo;
The telephone girl threw back her
bobbed hair. &ldquo;He goes out for golf at four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golf!&rdquo; exclaimed Pant. &ldquo;Tell him I must
see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him. But I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s no use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mopping the perspiration from his brow, the
boy sat down. A half hour passed; three-quarters.
A buzzer sounded on the telephone
girl&rsquo;s desk. She hurried back to a mahogany
walled office at the back of the room. A moment
later she reappeared, carried a sheaf of
papers to a typist, then returned to her post.
Not once did she glance at Pant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Forgotten me,&rdquo; was his mental comment.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the President&rsquo;s office she went into.
In the jungle we don&rsquo;t wait for things. We
go after them. I&rsquo;m off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a quick elastic step, he cleared the low
gate, and before a score of pairs of startled
eyes, marched straight for the mahogany
walled office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; a large, red cheeked man
sprang to his feet as he entered. Two others
at a table looked up enquiringly. &ldquo;Who sent
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one sent me. I came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s face showed
nothing. Pant felt uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chic&mdash;why, I&mdash;my grandfather shipped
some chicle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chicle. Go to the adjusting bureau. Can&rsquo;t
you see I&rsquo;m in conference?&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s voice
rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;you don&rsquo;t understand. You&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
Pant was becoming more and more confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Understand? Of course I understand.
You want an adjustment on chicle. Can&rsquo;t you
go where I tell you to?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>The boy was about to give up hope when a
familiar voice from behind spoke his name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Pant, old chap! How did you get up
here?&rdquo; the voice said.</p>
<p>Turning, he found himself staring into the
eyes of Kirk, his boy pal of that first adventure
in the Maya cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this some young friend of yours?&rdquo; The
man at the desk asked, turning to Kirk. His
tone had suddenly grown warm and friendly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why yes, Uncle, a very good friend from
Central America. We had some adventures
together. Remember the Maya cave? This
is Pant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Pant. Glad to meet you.&rdquo; The man
put out a hand. &ldquo;Tell you what, Pant, I&rsquo;ll
turn you over to my nephew. He&rsquo;ll help you
out. If there is anything he can&rsquo;t do, and I
can, come around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I&mdash;oh!&rdquo; Pant choked up, flushed,
then backed awkwardly out of the office. His
mind was in a whirl. So that was it, his companion
at the home of the old Don was a
favored nephew of the main stockholder in the
Central Chicle Company.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I told him once I thought the Company
unscrupulous in its dealings with smaller
holders,&rdquo; he thought to himself. &ldquo;I may have
been wrong. I only hope he has forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kirk had forgotten or forgiven, for he
treated the boy from Central America like a
long lost brother. Hurrying him out of the
noisy office, he led the way to a quiet little
eating place. There, after ordering a savory
lunch, he invited Pant to unburden his soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time to tell the whole story,&rdquo; Pant
thought to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kirk,&rdquo; he said suddenly, leaning far over
the table, &ldquo;you remember the story of the first
Don&rsquo;s silver box of pearls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; The other boy stared, unbelieving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. Pearls and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;where it is?&rdquo; stammered Kirk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In a chicle sack somewhere in the storeroom
of your uncle&rsquo;s company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is? How did it come there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The meal was eaten in haste while Pant told
his story.</p>
<p>Leaving the dessert for some future time,
the rich boy seized Pant by the arm and
dragged him out of the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t
a moment to lose. Chicle is scarce. Your
shipment will be sent at once to the factory.
There it will be unsacked and broken up. Here!
Jump in!&rdquo; He dragged his friend into a taxi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Trans-Atlantic Dock,&rdquo; he commanded
the driver.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><br />CHAPTER XXII
<br />A STARTLING REVELATION</h2>
<p>What of Johnny and his precious cargo?</p>
<p>As the days passed and land, the shore of
his native land, was sighted, the face of the
Unwilling Guest once more took on a shrewd,
calculating expression of a business man
whose financial interests are vast. Already,
in his mind, he was entering his office, was
sitting at his desk, dictating letters, pushing
buttons, issuing orders, calculating profits; he
was sitting in financial conferences with other
rich and successful men. Little wonder that
his chest began to bulge as he strolled the
deck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<p>They were not a day out from New York
when Johnny Thompson decided to find out
a few things. In spite of himself he had been
worried beyond endurance with the thought
that after all they had gone through they
might be defeated in the end, that the powerful
organization which was the Fruit Company
would make it impossible to sell their
fruit, perhaps even to land it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all right about the bananas,&rdquo; he said
to Madge. &ldquo;I can sell them direct to the
pushcart men. Like to do it, too,&rdquo; he chuckled.
&ldquo;Be great to go down in the Ghetto and see
the grinning faces of dirty little urchins as
they devour cheap bananas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grapefruit is different.&rdquo; His brow wrinkled.
&ldquo;Grapefruit must be sold to commission
men. That&rsquo;s where they may have us. Commission
men may fear the Fruit Company too
much to buy from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get off a wireless or two,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>As he emerged from the wireless room a
deep frown was on his brow. His worst fears
had been confirmed. Barney Tower, an old
trusted friend, had wired him that without the
permission of the Fruit Company&rsquo;s President
the Commission men would not dare purchase
his cargo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>Johnny smiled a little grimly at thought
of that very man, the President, who held all
the power, being his Unwilling Guest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer situation,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;By the aid of Providence we saved his life.
And yet, I would not dare ask him to lift
the ban on our cargo. I don&rsquo;t believe it would
be any use. The interests of his precious
Fruit Company must be preserved at all costs.
That&rsquo;s how he thinks of it, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down to think. Two minutes later
he sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might do it!&rdquo; He raced away in
search of Kennedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kennedy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are a Britisher.
Do you know anyone in Canada?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why yes, I ought to. Yes, yes, I do. The
harbor master in Toronto is an old war pal
of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The harbor master. What luck! Kennedy,
will the fruit keep an extra day?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Johnny, easily. Been cool air all the
way. Storm brought it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re safe. We&rsquo;re headed for Canada
right now. Nothing can stop us. We&rsquo;ll
sell our cargo there, and no one to bother
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how about him, your Unwilling
Guest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t charge him anything extra,&rdquo;
Johnny chuckled. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get a lot of good
out of the trip, find the sea breeze up there
quite bracing.&rdquo; He was away on the double
quick to notify the captain on the bridge.</p>
<p>Johnny was not the only one to note the
sudden swing of the ship as she entered on
her new course. The Unwilling Guest saw
it and came storming down the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; he demanded
angrily. &ldquo;Changing course again? Another
storm coming. Running again!&rdquo; His tone
was deeply scornful. &ldquo;A day late, and running
from a cloudless sky!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not running. Just going somewhere,&rdquo;
said Johnny quietly. &ldquo;Just going on our way.
Going to Canada.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canada! You said New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Changed our plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how about my plans? Your plans!&rdquo;
The man&rsquo;s face was red. He stuttered in his
rage. &ldquo;Your plans! Your business! Floating
a walnut shell in a teapot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty good old shell,&rdquo; said Johnny, glancing
up and down the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ship!&rdquo; said the magnate. &ldquo;Slow
and clumsy. A very derelict! The <i>Arion</i> now,
she&rsquo;s docked long since. If I had made Belize
in time&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Johnny. A new, compelling
light was in his eye. &ldquo;You wait. Come this
way. I&rsquo;ll show you where you would have
been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely knowing why he did it, the rich
man followed the boy to the captain&rsquo;s cabin
where the ship&rsquo;s log was kept.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<p>Turning back the pages, Johnny found the
record of that terrible night of storm. There,
pasted in, was the wireless man&rsquo;s record.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read that,&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s voice was solemn.</p>
<p>As the man read, his face took on a deadly
pallor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Can that be
true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All quite true,&rdquo; said Johnny huskily.
&ldquo;Had you not been becalmed out there in the
Caribbean Sea, had you made Belize on time
to catch the <i>Arion</i>, your Executive Council
would now be in session. They would be
electing a man to fill your place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may be doing that now. Who
knows that I am safe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do. No one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rich man shot out of the cabin and away
to the wireless cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know that I should have kept it
from him so long,&rdquo; Johnny thought. &ldquo;But a
shock now and then does us all good. It takes
considerable of a shock to register with such
a man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<p>That the shock had indeed registered, he
guessed rightly enough as he saw the short,
stout man, a half hour later, pacing the deck.
With hands behind his back and head bent
far forward, he appeared deep in thought.</p>
<p>Suddenly something seemed to come over
him. His head snapped up. He spun around,
then walked straight to the side of Johnny
Thompson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you change your plans? Why
are you headed for Canada?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should know the reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid of the Fruit Company&rsquo;s embargo?
You need not be. I am the Fruit Company.
I&mdash;why, I&rsquo;ll buy the cargo, buy it just as it
stands right here in the Atlantic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it?&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s face was a study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring your papers to my cabin, and I&rsquo;ll
show you, young man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strange thing happened. The voice of
the master business man, the head of a great
corporation, broke and for a moment he could
not speak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; he began again, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go tell the captain to alter his course,&rdquo;
said Johnny.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one other favor I wish to ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny was seated in the Unwilling Guest&rsquo;s
cabin. Perhaps by this time he might have
been called a &ldquo;willing guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;I hope I
can make you understand. It must be wonderful
to develop a business on a large scale,
to see it grow and grow and grow, as you have
been able to do. To add one ship after another,
one plantation, one narrow-gauge railroad
after another until the ships are a fleet,
railroads a system and the plantations a little
world all their own. I&rsquo;ve dreamed of living
such a life myself. It&rsquo;s a grand and glorious
dream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But sometimes,&rdquo; his tone was slow and
thoughtful, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s hard on the little fellow.
Sometimes the great promoter, dreaming his
great dream, forgets the little fellow, the man
with a few acres of bananas, a few cocoanuts
or grapefruit trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The elephant enjoys himself as he goes
thrashing his way through the jungle. But
what of the small creatures he tramples beneath
his feet? What about the butterflies he
crushes with his swinging trunk? The butterflies
appear to enjoy life as they flit in the
sunshine. What of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said the magnate rather
sharply, &ldquo;come down to brass tacks. What
is it you are talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then, specifically,&rdquo; Johnny smiled
broadly, &ldquo;there is a fine old man named
Kennedy who has a niece quite as fine. They
live in a Central American jungle. Every Carib
loves them because they love the Caribs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until you signed this agreement they were
very poor. The grapefruit aboard this ship
is theirs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not our Kennedy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our Kennedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kennedy,&rdquo; the rich man mused. &ldquo;That
name sounds familiar. Can it be that a Spaniard
name Diaz tried to purchase his grapefruit
orchard for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could be, and is true!&rdquo; exclaimed Johnny,
&ldquo;That was the wily Spaniard&rsquo;s game, preying
upon Kennedy&rsquo;s poverty. Planning to make a
large profit off land he hoped to buy from a
needy man for a song.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did Kennedy not tell me?&rdquo; the
rich man demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too modest, perhaps. And perhaps&mdash;you
will pardon me&mdash;perhaps he thought it would
do no good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Johnny continued, &ldquo;you are the
Fruit Company. You said that yourself. And
the Fruit Company refused to market
Kennedy&rsquo;s grapefruit because one year he sold
to an independent market. That&rsquo;s why they
are poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now?&rdquo; There was a strange look
on the man&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now I want you to sign a contract to
handle their fruit, a five year contract.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it ten!&rdquo; exclaimed the rich man,
springing to his feet. &ldquo;Have the purser write
it up and bring it to me at once. I&rsquo;ll sign it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And by the way,&rdquo; he said as Johnny prepared
to go, &ldquo;have Captain Jorgensen come
down when he finds time. This is a pretty
good old ship, a mighty good one. I want
her in my service. Give his owners a two
years&rsquo; contract. Or, I&rsquo;ll buy her straight out.
She&rsquo;s the ship that saved my life. Along with
two stubborn old men and a boy, she did it.
You don&rsquo;t meet a combination like that every
day.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c23"><br />CHAPTER XXIII
<br />TREASURE AT LAST</h2>
<p>With the aid of a flashlight Pant and Kirk
were exploring a vast warehouse filled with
sacks of chicle. They arrived in their taxi
and having been admitted, had been told in
a general way where they would find the last
cargo that had arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Here it is!&rdquo; exclaimed Pant at
last. &ldquo;I can recognize the weave of my grandfather&rsquo;s
sacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he said after a considerable
search for his particular sack, &ldquo;the thread has
been accidentally drawn out and lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it has,&rdquo; panted Kirk, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll open up
every one. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There it is!&rdquo; Pant pounced upon
a sack. The green thread shone along its
side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">[275]</div>
<p>With trembling fingers he cut the cord that
bound it. A moment later, carrying a mysterious
package wrapped in palm leaves, the
two boys passed out of the door.</p>
<p>A second taxi was hailed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better
go back to Uncle&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; said Kirk. &ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s
awfully square, and knows a lot. He&rsquo;ll
tell us what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pant scarcely heard him as he was crowded
once more into a taxi. His mind was in wild
commotion. At last he was in New York, in
possession of a vast treasure. Whose treasure
was it, the old Don&rsquo;s or his own? He had
read George Elliott&rsquo;s Romola, remembered
Tito, the traitor to an old man, and recalled
his terrible end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not be a traitor,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;If the treasure appears to belong to
the old Don he shall have it, every penny!&rdquo;
At that his troubled mind found rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Kirk, &ldquo;that you have
wondered how I came to be at the old Don&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Often,&rdquo; said Pant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, my Uncle is my guardian.
He holds nearly half the stock of his Company
in my name. When I am of age it will be
mine to manage. My Uncle believes I should
know all there is to be known about the business,
from the jungle to the wrapper,&rdquo; he
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he sent me down there. He got the
Carib giant for my bodyguard, and told me
to go where I chose, only to keep my eyes
open. I came at last to the old Don&rsquo;s. I liked
it so much up there that I stayed a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glorious, wasn&rsquo;t it!&rdquo; said Pant. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to live there with the old Don for a whole
year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, patting the package beside
him, &ldquo;will make the old Don rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old Don! It&rsquo;s yours!&rdquo; Kirk stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s his by direct inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that? Is there a monogram
or a coat of arms on the box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">[277]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will never be sure.&rdquo; The
younger boy&rsquo;s tone was earnest, entreating.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spoil the old Don by making him
rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not for us to decide what a man&rsquo;s
rightful possessions will do for him,&rdquo; said Pant
thoughtfully. &ldquo;The only question for us to
ask is, &lsquo;Are they his?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he said after a moment&rsquo;s silence,
&ldquo;your Uncle can help us out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure he can,&rdquo; said Kirk.</p>
<p>Nothing could exceed the astonishment of
the chicle magnate when, having lifted the
lid of the ancient silver box, his eyes fell upon
the treasure of pearls within. Instinctively,
he stepped back and locked the door to his
office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the greatest treasure that ever
rested on my desk,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;We must
get them to the vault for the night. And you
say they belong to Kirk&rsquo;s friend, the old
Don?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">[278]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; said Pant. Sitting on
the edge of a chair, leaning far forward, muscles
tense, eyes aglow, he told the story of the
beaten silver box from beginning to end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; sighed the magnate when the tale
was told. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite a yarn. Wouldn&rsquo;t
believe a word of it if it weren&rsquo;t for this.&rdquo; He
touched the silver box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Legally, in a court of law,&rdquo; he said, rubbing
his forehead thoughtfully, &ldquo;your old Don
wouldn&rsquo;t have much chance. You could hold
the pearls. Anyway, in this case possession is
nine points of the law. You have only to pay
the duty on them, then sell them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to do the square thing,&rdquo; the
magnate interrupted. &ldquo;Then why not call it
a case of salvage, and split the proceeds fifty-fifty.
That will give each of you more money
than you are likely to have any use for, and
certainly more than you need.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your grandfather is interested in chicle,&rdquo;
he added, &ldquo;tell him I&rsquo;ll sell you an interest in
our Company. Then in years to come you
and Kirk will be partners. Pant and Kirk,
Chicle Exporters. How does that sound?&rdquo;
He threw back his head and laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">[279]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Great! Wonderful!&rdquo; they exclaimed together.</p>
<p>The beaten silver box took one more ride
that day&mdash;to the Custom&rsquo;s offices. There it
was placed in a vault until the value of the
pearls could be settled upon.</p>
<p>A few days later the pearls were parcelled
out in groups and sold to several dealers for
a considerable fortune.</p>
<p>A few days after the docking of the <i>North
Star</i>, a happy group sat about a table in a small
dining room of the most sumptuous of New
York hotels. They had met there, Johnny,
Pant, Kennedy and Madge, for a farewell
feast. Business had been disposed of, and the
Kennedys were going home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; said Kennedy as he rose to stand
before a pretty open fireplace, &ldquo;it would be
nice if we might have a bit of a wood fire.
Makes a fellow feel sort of cheerful.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">[280]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not there. You couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Johnny.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a real fireplace. It has no flue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what is it for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To add a suggestion of comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only half satisfied, the old jungle man sat
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems a bit stuffy,&rdquo; he said a moment
later. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s open a window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are not windows,&rdquo; said Johnny.
&ldquo;They are looking-glasses that seem windows.
We are probably a half block from any outer
wall. This hotel covers an entire block.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sham!&rdquo; said Kennedy, rising. &ldquo;This
whole thing&rsquo;s sham. This is my party. I&rsquo;m
paying the bill. There&rsquo;s a real ship with a real
cabin down in the harbor. There are real
windows in her that look out on a real harbor.
I propose that we eat there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So aboard the ship they dined and talked.
The food was good. The talk was better. Old
days and new were discussed. Pant was to
sail with the Kennedys. He was going back
to Central America to make his grandfather
and the old Don comfortable for life. The
Kennedys were going home. That was quite
enough for them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">[281]</div>
<p>Johnny, who alone was to remain, felt a
little lonesome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; Johnny said to Madge as they
parted, &ldquo;when I am tired, when the rush and
push that is our America gets too much for
me, I am coming back to Stann Creek, to
listen to the thrum of the banjo and the Caribs&rsquo;
song, to watch the moon rise over the jungle
and to smell the forbidden fruit ripening on
the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do,&rdquo; said Madge Kennedy, brushing
at her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The latchstring&rsquo;s out and the door swings
in,&rdquo; said Kennedy, gripping his hand, &ldquo;and
may God bless you for all you have done.&rdquo;
So they parted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">[282]</div>
<p>Pant returned to the jungle. There he was
destined to remain for many a day to come;
for was not his Grandfather there and the old
Don, and last but not least, the beautiful
Senorita Ramoncita Salazar? What better
company could he ask and what more thrilling
adventures could be found than awaits
one at every turn of jungle trail?</p>
<p>As for Johnny, the city with its imitation
fireplaces, its mirror windows and much more
that is artificial and unreal, could not hold him
long. One day he met a curious sort of chap
with a strange hobby. Fascinated by this
man&rsquo;s tale of adventure, he joined company
with him. The story of these fresh adventures
in a land far from tropical wilds will
be found in our next book, &ldquo;Johnny Long-Bow.&rdquo;</p>
